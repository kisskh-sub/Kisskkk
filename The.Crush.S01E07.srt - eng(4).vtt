(Grudge and Arson)

00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:08.142
(Wang's Tea Estate's Warehouse)

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.080
There's so much tea here.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.200
How would I know
which one is the tribute tea?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.400
Let's just burn them all!

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.000
Why are you here?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.120
What are you doing?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.200
I want to use their own methods

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.280
against them.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.920
Burn them all down!

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.760
Mr. Wang is despicable,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.560
but we'll find our own way
to revenge him.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.080
Even if you burn this place down,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.880
our tribute tea won't get any better.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.880
You can tolerate this, but I can't!

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.080
Don't forget

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.240
your mother kept compromising
and tolerating back then,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.280
so got bullied to death
by your stepmother.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.760
Want to end up like her?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.680
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.960
Don't take it to heart.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.120
(Yuanfeng Sixth Year,)

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.080
(Mr. Wang secretly damaged
the Li's tribute tea with drugs.)

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.720
(Wei Xiaotang)

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.040
(committed arson)

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.240
(with Zixuan to destroy
Wang's tea warehouse to revenge him.)

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.360
(The flames also
ignited Zixuan's resolve.)

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.080
Young Master.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.000
Young Master.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I heard last night,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.320
the Wang's Tea Estate's
warehouse caught fire.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.640
Really?

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.680
Really.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.240
Really?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.600
Really, Young Master.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.120
That must've caused huge losses!

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.720
I was about to celebrate,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.080
but then heard

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.320
Mr. Wang had shipped
the tribute tea away.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.960
Can you believe it?

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.000
He's really lucky then.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.080
Forget it. Let's focus on

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.400
finding a way to restore the tea.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.880
I thought of someone.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.760
Who is it?

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.680
But

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.800
you need to use your charms.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120
You can't do that.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.120
It has to be you.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.560
That eager to go?

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.880
No, not really.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.280
Do you know where we're going?

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.280
Want to come?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.920
Where?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.160
(Tianxiang Tea House)
Miss Niaoniao.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.240
We want you

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.120
to teach us the technique

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.200
of tea washing.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.480
Please,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.760
share your expertise.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.240
Young Master.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.960
Or,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.440
I should address you as Madam Li.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.200
I have a favor to ask.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.960
I wish to speak with Mr. Li privately.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.360
May I?

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.760
Okay.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.280
It is improper.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.720
Our priority.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.600
Have a good chat.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.160
I'll go out. Have a good chat.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.320
I'll wait outside.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.280
Mr. Li, please.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.840
Go! Hurry!

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.560
You got this.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.720
Miss Niaoniao, just say what you want.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.920
Share your expertise,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.840
and we'll offer you a generous reward.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.760
Mr. Li.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.760
Let me explain about last time.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.720
The tea house

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.640
asked us to use aphrodisiac incense

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.800
with floral tea,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.160
and I had to do so.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.760
I have to apologize to you.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.200
Actually, I've long admired you.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.880
When we met that day,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.320
I was genuinely captivated by you.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.560
I love you at first sight.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.840
So, about
the aphrodisiac incense that day...

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.080
I did have ulterior motives.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.720
Driven by affection,

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.680
I wanted a fleeting romance with you.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.600
Miss Niaoniao.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.160
I am a married man.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.800
Please maintain respect.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.880
I know I am not noble enough

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.720
to deserve you.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.240
But I never fear to love someone.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.640
I can teach you the unique technique

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.760
to wash the tea leaves.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.800
But I have a condition.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.920
What is it?

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.960
You claimed to be a married man,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.080
so you had to reject me.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.640
My condition is simple.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.720
You divorce your wife.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.560
I refuse.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.160
Don't!

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.160
Don't!

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.040
I agree.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.400
I agree.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:02.760
Miss Niaoniao.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.920
If you teach Zixuan the technique,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.360
we'll divorce now.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.160
Absurd!

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.920
The competition is tomorrow!

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.360
What's there to hesitate now?

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.040
Just get a divorce.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:21.600
Divorce.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.920
Wei Xiaotang,
what are you talking about?

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.960
You are

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.920
my legitimate wife.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.720
You divorce me that easily?

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.040
In that case,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.040
I won't participate in

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.640
the tea competition.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.760
Our tea leaves are ruined.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
As long as

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.800
it doesn't involve
killing or harming anyone,

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.640
why can't you agree?

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:44.760
Ridiculous!

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:46.880
Miss Niaoniao.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.760
We'll divorce.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.560
Li Zixuan! Li Zixuan!

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.760
Why are you being so stubborn?

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.000
Don't stick to trifles.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.960
This is no trifle.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.960
You're being ridiculous!

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.920
Fine.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.320
I'm being ridiculous!

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.680
I'm shameless.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.560
But let's talk about business.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.080
Now you identified the problem,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.520
then you must solve it.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.560
Moreover,

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.280
between you and me,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.160
it's at most a business marriage.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.000
Why are you acting
like we're deeply in love?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.360
Besides,

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.680
when I helped you eliminate your uncle

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.160
and dealt with tea merchants,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.760
why didn't you say
I was being ridiculous?

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.160
My goal is to obtain the Top Tea.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.160
If I can't,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.120
then I can't go back!

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.560
Then stay with me

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.960
until we get the Top Tea.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.840
Maybe

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.560
let's go back to Miss Niaoniao.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.400
Go home.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.720
If you don't agree,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.640
I won't go home.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.320
Up to you.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.960
I won't stay here.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:18.320
Li...

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.520
Is he some spoony?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:25.800
Li Zixuan!
