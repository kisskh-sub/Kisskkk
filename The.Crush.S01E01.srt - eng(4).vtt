=Episode 1=
(Another World's Mother-in-Law War)

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.080
(In the Li Manor,)

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.760
(scheming lurks everywhere.)

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.560
(Being submissive and compromising)

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.560
(will only invite endless abuse.)

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.040
(Only by taking)

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.120
(the initiative can I survive)

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.880
(and return to my original world.)

00:01:18.848 --> 00:01:22.176
(Li Zixuan, Li family's eldest son)

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.384
(Wei Xiaotang, Wei family's daughter)

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.560
Wei Xiaotang used to be
a daughter in the Wei family,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880
(Second concubine of Li family)
but here, she is a daughter-in-law.

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:39.560
(Maternal uncle)

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.160
Tomorrow, I'll teach her

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.840
the proper conduct of a bride.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.560
(Li Manor)

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.960
I brought my bride to serve you tea.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.080
The bride shall serve tea
to her mother-in-law.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.880
Why look at him? Serve tea.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.320
Here.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.320
Do it.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.600
When a bride serves tea,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.920
she must kneel.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800
Our family does have this tradition.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.400
Madam, please kneel.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.320
What?

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.360
Are you implying

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.120
I'm not worthy
of your kneeling as your mother-in-law?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.520
Your family begged to marry me.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.120
You think you can bully me now?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.360
You...

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.200
What?

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.080
I've seen countless like you.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.960
A malicious mother-in-law

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.160
who only knows how to nitpick.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.080
First complaining
the tea is cold, and then it is hot.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.400
You won't enforce your rules on me!

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.600
This...

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.200
You...

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.200
Our family has lost all decorum!

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.000
Even a newlywed bride

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.600
disrespects her mother-in-law

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.560
like this?

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.080
Speaking to me so affectionately,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.600
while being a backstabber.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.840
Should I expose all your schemes?

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.000
Last night, uncle...

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.120
What's wrong?

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.520
Zixuan, this wedding wine
was gifted by your mother.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.160
May you two be united as one,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.560
bound in mutual trust and affection.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.600
But was this truly wedding wine

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.240
or poisoned wine?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.040
You know the truth.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.920
You...

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.920
What?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.720
You...

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.960
You're a madwoman!

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.320
How insolent!

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.120
Losing composure already?

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.280
We're just getting started.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.240
I haven't even mentioned

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.000
all your dirty deeds yet.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.880
Li Zixuan lost his biological
mother when he was little.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.000
You cared for him,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.440
but starved and deprived him constantly.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.760
If he had not been resilient,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.120
he wouldn't have survived.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.640
Wei Xiaotang! You lunatic!

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.880
These are all lies!

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.720
Lies?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.640
Your

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.400
malicious intent

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.160
has been so obvious.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.680
You're the epitome of a poisonous widow.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.240
Guards! Restrain this madwoman!

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.960
You think feigning madness

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.400
and slandering me will save you?

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.160
I tolerated your disrespect,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.480
but as our family's bride,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.960
you lack chastity.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.920
You've shamed our family.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.280
This cannot go unpunished.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.240
Mother, what do you mean?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.040
After you spent last night,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.920
why was the handkerchief on the bed

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.200
stainless?

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.280
You're clearly unchaste!

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.920
Xuan,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.640
I've failed

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.040
in my duties,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.520
letting you marry

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.240
this shameless woman!

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.800
Allowing this tainted woman
to marry into our family

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.400
has utterly ruined

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.920
our family's reputation!

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.960
You defiled our household

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.480
and slandered me.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.200
Unchaste and unfilial!

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.280
By law,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.080
we can burn you at the stake!

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.640
I...

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.200
What are you doing?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.320
It is so hilarious.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.000
Burning a living person alive

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.640
because of missing virgin blood?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.760
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.440
Now, I am the matriarch
of the Li family.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.080
I decide all matters within the family.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.160
You're just a woman here.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.520
Even if Master Li
were still alive today,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.240
after such a scandal occurred,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.600
he wouldn't protect you.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.600
Let go.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.160
That wasn't her fault.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.400
I was drunk last night

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.600
and failed in my duties.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.400
What?

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.520
We've gone through formal wedding rites,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.240
but this is merely a fake marriage.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.720
We need to only play our roles

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.080
as husband and wife

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.800
in public.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.040
Don't let the Li family find out.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.720
Do you understand?

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.320
(Lin Yuhao, CEO of a gaming company)
(I was the CEO of a gaming company.)

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.040
(An accident transported
me into my own game.)

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.560
(It begins on my wedding night)

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.760
(when my husband was poisoned to death.)

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.720
(I stole the antidote)

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.320
(from an NPC in the game.)

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.480
(To escape this world, I must complete)

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.680
(the Top Tea mission.)

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.520
(I need an ally.)

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.400
(Li Zixuan, it has to be you.)

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.800
Starting today,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.400
I'll help you secure
the position as head of Li family,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.120
and you'll help me
earn the Top Tea title.

00:07:34.368 --> 00:07:42.944
(Game Mission)
