I've reached a partnership
with Song Zhizhi.

Good.

Our people just reported back.

Guess where our missing batch

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.740
of rough gemstones ended up.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.100
Where?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.380
In the Song family's warehouse.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.580
Those rough gemstones

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.340
have been sitting
in the Song's warehouse all along.

Your mother

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.140
was an artist deeply passionate

about jewelry design.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.260
After we married,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.180
she brought out
her family's ancient gold craftsmanship.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.020
That's what built the Dafu Jewelry.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.100
But the theft of the rough gemstones

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.100
was a devastating blow to Dafu Jewelry.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.180
Your mother was too proud.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.340
She never recovered from it.

I know.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.460
I never imagined our rough gemstones

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.940

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.500
after all these years.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.580
My suspicions were right.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.900
After Dafu withdrew from the market,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.900
Starlight Jewelry
quickly took over its market share.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.220

had sinister ambitions.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.460
He forced me out of Starlight Jewelry

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.660
and tried to destroy Dafu.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.180
Don't forget
why you're getting close to the Songs.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.020
Don't worry.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.060
I'll never forget

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.620

or to me.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.900
Ji Baijian is quite the ally.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.180
Between a man and a woman,
it's usually one of three things.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.860
Money, romance, or family.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.500
If it's not about money or romance,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.260
is it family?

that I'm after

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.260
the Song family's fortune, do you?

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.140
Of course not.

for this family over the years.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.820
This is

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.380
all Ms. Zhu's fault.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.020
You had nothing to do with it.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.900
Zhizhi, you've really grown up.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.820

my care for you
hasn't been given in vain.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.020
Lately, I've been wondering

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.860
if I have done something wrong

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.060
that made you misunderstand me

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.740
and created a rift between us.

I've wronged you, babe.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.060
Zhizhi,

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.420
I promise

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.060
nothing like this
will ever happen again.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.100
Trust me.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:36.580
Please?

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.180
If I didn't trust you,

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.900
I wouldn't be here.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.220
Zhizhi,

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.460
let's start over.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:46.540
Will you?

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.340
But...

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.820
You know, my dad

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.020
has never approved of us.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.540
He thinks you're not good enough for me.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.620
And now with this big mess,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:12:59.820
I'm afraid he...

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.300
I get it.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.100
I totally understand.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.060
How about this?

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.860
Starlight Jewelry is holding
a design competition soon.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.020
If I win the championship,

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.620
wouldn't that prove myself
to your father

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:15.700
and everyone else?

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.300
If you win,

about this competition.

I should go.

Ms. Song, it seems

you really enjoy

I wouldn't have called you here.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.940
You're the one who told me

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.860
not to fall out with Yi Wenhan.

how am I supposed
to work with you like this?

Last time I called,

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.860
you were so cold to me.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.620
I was worried.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.900
I worried you might see me as a burden.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.500
And now you're the one getting mad?

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.420
If you were worried,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.380
you shouldn't have messed
with me in the first place.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.140
If I had had any other choice,

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:40.460

Sorry.

Next time,

I'll discuss everything
with you first. Alright?

has a dedicated department
for purchasing rough gemstones.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.060

ask to meet me here?

Baijian, the jewelry competition
is coming up.

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.780
I have no inspiration.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.180
So I thought I'd come out
to look for some.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:14.780
Okay.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.940
Don't forget
why you're getting close to the Songs.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.020
Look at this.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.660
Doesn't its color and luster

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.380
look like that
of a Sri Lankan rough gemstone?

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.220
Kind of.

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.740
But the quality is nowhere close.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.940
Why are you so interested

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.260
in those rough gemstones?

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.500
Nothing much. Just curious.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:16.740
Alright.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.780
Let's see what you've made.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.980
You used just these two colors

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.060
and created something
so refreshingly unique.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.420
Not bad.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:39.500
Now help me put it on.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:54.900
Thanks.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.180

This is a secret.

You can't tell anyone.

Good thing you brought him in time.

But I still recommend
further examination.

I'm fine. Just tired lately.
