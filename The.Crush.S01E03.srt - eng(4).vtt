=Episode 3=
(A Couple's Battle Against Tea Farmers)

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.560
Beyond these bamboos

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.800
lies the tea mountain.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.200
Let me ask you.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.680
Be honest with me.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.400
Do you have a crush?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.280
This is absurd.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.400
Think about it.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.960
If a woman stays by your side

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.360
and you remain calm,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.000
doesn't that mean

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.840
you have a crush?

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.280
This looks like the year
of my coming-of-age ceremony.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.880
I went alone to pick tea leaves

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.760
when big rain struck,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.480
and I fell off a cliff.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200
One person in white
with tied-up hair saved me.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.280
I only remember that one

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.800
was carrying a handkerchief
with crabapple flowers.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.680
So you're saying

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.040
you don't even know

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.080
that person's gender?

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.360
Right.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.080
(He)

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.160
(didn't even see the face clearly)

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.800
(but still pines for her?)

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.160
She showed me kindness.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.360
In this lifetime,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.000
I'll never forget her favor.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.800
Let me remind you.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.080
Gratitude and love
are totally different.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.120
The tea plantation is there, right?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.640
If the tea grade drops by one tier,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.160
the price difference becomes 30 percent.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.120
If we mix high and low grades
to sell to the Li family,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.400
we'll make at least double the profit.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.800
He won't notice our scheme, will he?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.120
Li Zixuan just became the head.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.600
This is his first time here.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.560
He won't confront us.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.720
In this world,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.960
the bold feast while the timid starve.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.120
If we don't take advantage now

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.920
and wait until he becomes shrewd,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.080
we'll miss our chance.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920
Well said!

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.760
They're here.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.320
Let's go.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.120
Let's go.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.080
Mr. Li, you've arrived.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.280
The sample tea leaves are prepared.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.200
I'll inspect them.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.760
Of course. Please inspect.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.520
Mr. Li,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.680
these tea leaves

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.880
were all picked before sunrise.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.080
Same as always,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.040
we reserve the finest tea leaves

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.960
for your family.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.440
These are

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.160
the top-grade pre-Qingming buds.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.400
For generations,
we've supplied tea to you

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.680
without negligence.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.280
How are they?

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.440
The sample tea seems fine.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.360
After full weighing,
come collect payment.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.760
Could you please

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.920
deliver the tea to our manor?

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.000
So the arrangement remains as before?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.920
Yes.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.160
Not appropriate.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.760
Now that we've only seen the samples,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.320
we'll pay a deposit first.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.720
After all tea is delivered to the manor,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.760
we'll naturally pay in full.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.440
This isn't right.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.680
By the old rules,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.800
payment was made
immediately after sampling.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.520
Exactly.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.760
We did so before.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.840
Now, it's different.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.120
You look unfamiliar, young sir.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.400
Might I ask your relation to the Mr. Li?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.280
It doesn't matter.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.720
What's important is

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.880
whether the tea leaves
beyond these samples

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.000
have any issues.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.000
Mr. Li,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.760
we've supplied tea
to your family for generations.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.360
Between us,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.720
trust is paramount.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.640
Everyone, look.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.200
All the tea is right here
in the courtyard.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.360
If there's any problem,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.080
we'll know upon inspection.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.560
And if no issues are found?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.960
If there's no problem,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.520
we will pay double.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.520
Deal.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.520
Begin.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.400
Let's start.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.880
Mr. Li,

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.160
is there an issue with this tea?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.680
The leaves look natural

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.640
and feel tender.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.880
Good tea.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.400
Does your earlier promise still stand?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.480
Continue.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.640
Sir,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.200
you don't intend to inspect

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.520
all the tea leaves, do you?

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.760
Be patient.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.360
Three's the limit.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.120
We'll check two more baskets.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.000
Could he have discovered?

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.680
Let me do it.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.240
Look at his fair, delicate appearance.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.080
He clearly never worked
on a tea mountain.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.000
Good or bad tea.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.560
He probably can't tell the difference.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.640
If he distinguished them,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.720
our decades of tea farming
would be a joke.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.120
It's obvious.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.680
Even if we placed
inferior tea before him,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.880
he likely couldn't identify it.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.560
Ever since Master Li passed,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.800
their family has been falling.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.200
Rich families breed
nothing but wastrels.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.320
No wonder their tea business

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.200
keeps worsening.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.480
Zixuan.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.680
Let's inspect this basket.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.280
Yes.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.760
Well...

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.440
(They're still providing inferior tea).

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.960
(My father showed
mercy out of old ties,)

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.680
(but it's different now.)

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.800
Tea buds that grow

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.840
among clustered leaves

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.120
in groups of three, four or five.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.960
Only the most prominent shoots
get picked.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.200
The top-grade tea leaves

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.400
should be tender

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.480
like the sample we saw earlier.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.800
But this leaf lacks
both form and essence.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.480
Clearly the lower-grade one.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.840
It's inferior tea.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.800
Well played.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.560
Using premium tea prices to sell
mixed inferior tea leaves.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.680
Trying to cheat our family.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.160
This trick ends now and forever.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.080
Mr. Li,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.480
we have traded for generations.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.920
This outsider

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.560
is interfering,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.240
sowing discord.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.720
We demand an explanation.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.520
Who is he?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.600
What authority does he
have to boss us around?

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:54.480
Alright.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.840
Since you demand to know my identity,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.320
I'll tell you.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.120
I am the Madam of the Li family,

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.240
Wei Xiaotang.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.840
She's a woman.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.160
Mr. Li,

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.680
your family has an ancestral rule.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.200
Women can't engage in business.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.760
Rules are made by people,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.280
and people can change them.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.240
Today I'm here

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.480
to reform the family rules.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.240
Women should stay at home,
being obedient.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.400
You want to alter traditions?

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.120
Why should we heed a woman's words?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:28.760
Alright.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.880
You don't have to.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.600
But after we spread word

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.600
of this inferior tea scam today,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.800
see which tea merchant

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.160
in Haiqing Town will buy from you again.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.680
I heard Mr. Li married the daughter

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.960
of Lord Taozhu in Haiqing Town.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:45.840
Well...

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.240
Mr. Li,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.896
there was a sorting error.

00:10:00.896 --> 00:10:02.304
I'll immediately separate

00:10:02.304 --> 00:10:03.168
these leaves by grade

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.360
and deliver them.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.760
Good.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.240
We only accept top-grade tea.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.800
Thank you.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.360
You should've complied earlier.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.280
Sort the mixed leaves yourselves.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.680
We'll be waiting.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.120
How did you detect the problem

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.120
in those tea baskets?

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.720
That bamboo basket

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.960
readily absorbs moisture.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.240
And its color changes

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.240
with the humidity.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.600
I didn't expect you
to be so resourceful.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.680
Even if I didn't spell it out,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.800
you had sensed it, right?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.760
They have been supplying

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.640
tea to us for generations.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.560
Those traditions
were established by my forefathers.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.920
If you play the gentleman with them,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.360
they'll respond with trickery.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.960
If those two were truly honest men,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.200
we'd treat them fairly without question.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.960
But those tea farmers

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.440
are

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.640
so deceitful.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.760
Haven't you heard

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.960
of fighting fire with fire?

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.480
Dishonest people like them

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.800
see kindness

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.080
as a weakness.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.480
Listen up.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.560
Li Zixuan,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.960
in business, without firm methods,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.560
there's no room for mercy.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720
Mr. Li.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.600
Mr. Li.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:31.840
Mr. Li.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.080
I finally caught up with you.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.080
Our plantation has been
infested with pests.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.640
Could you please come take a look?
