(Luring the Enemies into the Trap)

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.000
Everyone, we're holding a funeral today.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.440
What's the meaning of this?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.400
Just wait. The show is about to begin.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.920
But I heard those tea farmers

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.240
signed contracts with Zixuan.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.600
Now that Zixuan is gone,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.000
those contracts are void.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.640
They plan to sell at higher prices

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.720
to other tea estates.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.720
These are all baseless rumors.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.520
Though Zixuan has passed,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.840
Zimo will take charge

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.960
of collecting the tea from the farmers.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.840
Please rest assured.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.680
Spare us

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.120
your empty promises now.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.080
If you have the tea,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.320
take it out now.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.560
Yes, show us.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.080
Everyone,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.240
how about giving us a few more days?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.680
We'll deliver your tea...

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.480
Madam,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.440
we're small business owners.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.800
We paid money

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.880
to your family.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.560
If you can't provide the tea now,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.800
report this

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.000
to the yamen!

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.800
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.320
Exactly!

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.240
Let the yamen see

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.680
what valuables they have.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.280
Or they can

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.200
sell this residence!

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.720
Right!

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.320
They'll sell your family estate.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.240
If this house is sold,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.880
where will we live?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.960
That's not our concern.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.920
What's that to us?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.080
This...

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.480
Mr. Wang.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.920
Such a big thing.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.760
Mr. Wang!

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.040
No one informed me?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.440
Hurry!

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.320
I just learned it.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.480
I came late.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.880
How could this happen?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.920
Zixuan!

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.760
So young,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.040
why such tragedy?

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.520
Heaven envies the talented!

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.760
Mr. Wang.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.320
Not proper.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.640
Madam Li, please accept condolences.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.360
Take care of yourself.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.200
The deceased deserves respect.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.400
I'll burn some paper offerings
for Zixuan first.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.040
Zixuan,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.360
may your journey be peaceful.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.600
Lady, what was
the earlier commotion about?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.720
W-W-What's happened now?

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.320
Zixuan just had an accident.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.480
Before the tea could be collected,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560
these tea merchants

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.000
insist on demanding their tea now.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.200
No compromise whatsoever.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.400
If we accommodate you,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.880
who'll accommodate our debts?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.280
Who'll pay our rents?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.600
Exactly.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.880
Will you pay our rents?

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.520
Everyone,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.320
hear me out.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.760
The Wang and Li families
have been allies for generations.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.280
Now that tragedy strikes the Lis,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.400
we Wangs won't stand idly by.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.400
Lady, I have a tea reserve

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.080
that can be distributed.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.320
Really?

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.320
Abandoning allies isn't the Wang way.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.520
But I'm still a businessman.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.600
I can't operate at a loss.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.120
The help is one thing,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.760
but business is business.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.680
- Something must be made clear upfront.
- The real show is about to begin.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.280
Lady,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.440
your family's new head

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.480
Zixuan is gone,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.480
and Zimo

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.800
is young

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and inexperienced.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.600
He can't manage the business yet.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.600
You needn't repay my tea reserve.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.480
Instead, I will manage

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.440
your tea estate from now on.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.240
Instead of standing idly by,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.960
you're exploiting our disaster!

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.680
Why are you being so harsh?

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.760
I'm just offering timely assistance.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.840
Lady,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.040
your family business
is a complete mess now.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.600
You wouldn't want everyone

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.080
to make things difficult
for Zimo, would you?

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.520
So

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.680
I'll give you 30 percent

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.960
of the profits.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.400
You and Zimo can remain figureheads

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.320
while I manage operations.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.360
This Mr. Wang is quite the schemer.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.200
He's more cunning than a monkey.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.920
What do you say?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.560
That's good, mother.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.800
We demand at least 50 percent.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.640
Mother,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.520
Zixuan's body isn't even buried.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.000
What do you mean by this?

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.160
How can we surrender
our ancestors' legacy?

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.520
I'll cover the tea merchants' payments.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.760
How could I forget?

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.040
Isn't this the daughter
of the Wei family, Lord Taozhu's family?

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.520
Yeah, this petty sum

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.440
is mere pocket change

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.280
for the wealthy Wei family.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.160
Lady, think carefully.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.160
If the Weis bail you out,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.040
you'll lose all authority

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.240
in your family tea estate.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.320
Let's work together instead.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.760
I'll give you 50 percent.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.800
This way, you won't be subordinate

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.680
to that junior.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.480
Right?

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.560
You just came to our family.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.880
What right do you have
to speak on our family affairs?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.520
I'm Li Zixuan's legally wedded wife.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.640
Now that he's gone,

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.080
I have every right to speak.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.840
You married Zixuan,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.400
and immediately, this happened to him.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.640
You brought this disaster to him.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.040
A cursed jinx!

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.880
Exactly!

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.160
A widowed child bride

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.240
knows nothing about business!

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.880
Squander your family's wealth

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.120
if you want since your family is rich.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.000
But

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.520
don't drag

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.960
us down.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.360
Right?

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.080
- That's right!
- Absolutely!

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:14.360
Guards!

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.280
Get the Madam out!

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.600
She has no voice here!

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.880
She has no voice here.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.840
What about me?

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.680
Young Master.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.560
Zixuan.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.240
Young Master!

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.080
Zixuan.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.800
He's alive!

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.360
I was framed
at the tea mountain yesterday

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.520
and nearly killed.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.440
Xiaotang saved me.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.920
This ordeal helped me

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.960
see people's true colors.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.160
Zixuan, I...

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.320
I'm a mere woman

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.480
unaccustomed to such crises.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.960
Please forgive my earlier actions.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.760
Don't worry.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440
As long as I live,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.920
no one will seize

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.640
our family's enterprises.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.920
I'll restore our family's glory

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.000
to my grandfather's founding days.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.800
We'll reclaim our title as the Top Tea.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.600
Mr. Li,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.240
we're relieved

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.080
you're okay.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.960
What about our tea?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.600
Don't worry.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.600
You'll receive every ounce of tea owed.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.840
My men will deliver it shortly.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.640
Xiaotang is my wife.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.880
She fiercely protected
our family's interests.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.440
From now on,

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.120
we'll co-manage the family.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.280
No one, inside or outside,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.480
shall mistreat Xiaotang.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.120
Understood?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.320
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.120
I hear your tea estate

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.880
thrives

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.000
under my daughter's guidance.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.840
I feared it'd be

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.760
(Mr. Wei, Lord Taozhu in Haiqing)
a mismatch.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.880
But now, it seems

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.800
they're deeply in love and harmonious

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.120
and work together seamlessly.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.920
That puts my mind at ease.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.800
Mrs. Li, my daughter
was raised with utmost care.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.760
Has she caused you any trouble?

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.800
Mr. Wei,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.520
not at all.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.520
Xiaotang

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.040
is very sensible.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.320
That's good to hear.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.320
If she ever displeases you in any way,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.520
please be understanding.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.160
After all, my daughter

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.440
can't be scolded

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.760
or criticized.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.760
Father.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.400
Let's skip the formalities.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.120
Get to the main point.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.960
I came today

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.480
with an important matter

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.520
to inform you.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.360
This year's tribute tea selection
differs from those of previous years.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.360
The local magistrate

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.400
will host
an unprecedented tea competition.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.600
The champion of this contest

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.880
will qualify
for the Top Tea championship.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.400
Zixuan, do you have the confidence

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.360
to win this competition?

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.680
I will spare no effort

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.160
to meet your expectations.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.560
Father, don't worry.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.840
Zixuan and I

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.760
will earn the Top Tea title.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.440
I mean,

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.560
I'll assist my husband in victory.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.360
That's more like it.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.280
Obtaining the Top Tea title

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.120
is crucial to me.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:55.920
So

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.760
we need to sign a contract.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.520
Business is business.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.480
Written agreements are most reliable.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.400
Review the terms.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.320
If no problem with it,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.560
sign and stamp it.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.560
Today, Li Zixuan and Wei Xiaotang
make this contract.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.800
(Contract)
After winning the title,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.640
Li Zixuan shall consummate
the marriage with Wei Xiaotang.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.440
Does such a thing
need to be written down?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.720
Absolutely.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.400
I truly don't understand

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.680
why you insist on

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.160
winning the Top Tea title.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.880
Let me ask you.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.880
Haven't you noticed

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.160
since our wedding night,

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.520
I've been acting strangely?

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.360
In the western suburbs,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.560
by the river, under the bridge,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.600
there's a Lady Tea selling tea.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.560
She gave me an antidote

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.760
that saved your life,

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.720
leading to our current story.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.000
To put it simply,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.240
your entire world

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.880
was created by us.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.560
Like characters in a script,

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.720
everyone here,

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.200
their destinies, personalities,
preferences and morals

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.400
all were crafted by us.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.400
Everything in this world

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.480
is our creation.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.760
Including you, of course.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.080
So Lady Tea

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.040
told me

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.160
my mission was to help you win

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160
the Top Tea title

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.560
and consummate our marriage.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.400
Only then can I return

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.800
to my original world.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.000
I know it's hard to understand,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.960
but that's okay.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.920
Don't bother with that.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.080
Just remember this.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.840
We two

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.920
are in this together.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.120
Are we?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.040
Absolutely.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.600
Enough talk.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.200
Just sign the contract.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.840
Here, stamp your mark.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.880
I'll fetch the inkpad.

00:14:13.277 --> 00:14:21.216
(Game Mission)

00:14:21.216 --> 00:14:22.240
(Tianxiang Tea House)

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.760
This tea house masquerades

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.120
as a floral tea shop.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320
Actually, it's a brothel.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.240
Brothel?

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.720
Perfect for my needs.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.720
We're here for the Top Tea title.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.760
Within Mr. Wang's establishment,

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.320
this tea house
is his most profitable venture.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.600
Moreover, I've heard

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.320
there is

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.800
a celebrated courtesan
skilled in making floral teas.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.840
Many dignitaries from the capital

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.920
travel thousands of miles
just to see her.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.400
So what?

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.120
A vulgar place of indulgence.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.160
If you don't even understand

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.600
your competitor's business,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.920
how can you make the best tea?

00:15:33.408 --> 00:15:35.904
(Niaoniao, Star of Tianxiang Tea House)

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.800
When I plucked the strings today,
lingering resonance remained

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.760
as if an old friend
was stirring my emotions.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.840
And when I finished that melody

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.400
and saw you, sir,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.560
I did feel like

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.400
we were old friends.
