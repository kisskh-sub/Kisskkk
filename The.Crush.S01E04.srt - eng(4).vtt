(Lady Tea, Game NPC)
In men's clothes?

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.680
It's all because of

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.520
your absurd rules forbidding
women from doing business.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.880
I had no choice.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.880
It looks quite dashing on you.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.720
Tell me.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.360
What should I do next?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.360
What should you do?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.640
Just assist Li Zixuan

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.840
in earning the title of Top Tea

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.000
and get closer with him.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.960
Then you can return.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.880
Get closer?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.640
Wait.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.920
You mean we need to sleep together?

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.080
Hurry up and do it.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.240
Sleep together!

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.760
I'll find a way to do it.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.920
Madam.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.760
Lady.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.280
Aren't the young master with you?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.080
No.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.360
He went with some tea farmer

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.720
to check tea at Fairy Cliff.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.240
Fairy Cliff?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.360
There are no tea mountains there.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.240
No tea mountains there?

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.800
That's right.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.720
Madam.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.320
Your tea plantation is at Fairy Cliff?

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.760
Yes, Mr. Li.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.800
Right ahead.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.520
This way.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.240
This doesn't look like a tea plantation.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.520
Of course there is
no tea plantation here.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.280
Mr. Li.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.760
Sorry.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.720
I was just entrusted by someone.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.520
Taking money

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.560
and solving problems.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.240
In the underworld,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.240
don't blame me.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.480

Li Zixuan!

Li Zixuan!

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.560
It's over.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.520
All over.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.560
Li Zixuan! Li Zixuan!

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.040
Li Zixuan!

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.720
Without you,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.320
how can I create the Top Tea?

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.000

When Zixuan came of age,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.360
he fell off a cliff
when picking tea leaves.

(Coroner, Game NPC)
Wei Xiaotang

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.280
was the savior in white.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.440
But fate kept their paths crossed

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.360
without their knowledge.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.720

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.920
Why did you come for me?

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.440
I was afraid you might die.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.600
You care about me?

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.240
Of course.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.840
If you die,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.400
how can I create the Top Tea?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.200
How did you realize

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.880
that tea farmer was fishy?

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.120
Tea stems are juicy

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.880
yet astringent.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.560
Long-term exposure makes

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.800
one's fingers chapped

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.640
and turn dark.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.400
When Zhang San bowed to me,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.600
his fingers were clean.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.760
So I knew

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.320
he wasn't a tea farmer.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.000
Then why go with him

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.560
if you saw through his act?

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.360
Your employer sent you to kill me

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.880
to seize the tea I've acquired.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.560
But if I die,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.040
the county office will
trace the tea purchases

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.320
and follow the trail

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.440
straight to the mastermind.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.800
Take a guess.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.280
Will your employer

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.440
use you as a scapegoat?

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.720
How much is your employer paying you?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.280
I'll double it.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.960
Just return and tell him

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.400
that I'm dead.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.880
Then you'll get payment thrice.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.120
Enough to live comfortably.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.560
Isn't it?

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.240
Why should I trust you?

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.600
Enough?

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.000
Tell me, who is your employer?

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.520
I initially planned
to lay low for a while

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.200
and confront Mr. Wang

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.800
when he came to collect tea.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.960
But even if you testify against him,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.360
he might still deny everything.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.840
At best, we'd gain

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.120
minor leverage in business.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.520
But since you've already set the trap,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.680
let's expand the scheme further.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.080
How should we do it?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.280
Now, we have internal traitors
and outside enemies.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.120
We can't distinguish friends from foes.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.040
Chaos in the Li family

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.400
will show everyone's true colors.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.600
Then we'll lure the traitors out

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.320
and capture them in one sweep.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.680
Why would a young woman like you

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.720
develop such cunning strategies?

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.840
Did your past life involve

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.560
constant scheming?

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.720
True sincerity between people

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.800
is the rarest treasure.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.360
Everything in this world
is a transaction.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.400
That's an eternal truth.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.760
Does this

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.720
apply to us too?

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:19.440
Obviously.

00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:39.392
(Li Manor)

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.560
Master, the Li Manor
is holding a funeral.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.440
What about the tea shops?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.240
News has already spread.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.160
By day's end,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.880
the Li family head's death

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.320
will be known throughout Haiqing Town.

now compounded by fresh grief.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.920
My filial duties remain unfulfilled,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.920
so I can't join you in death.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.720
Xuan! It was just a tea-collecting trip.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.680
How did it turn into this separation?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.120
The pain of burying my child.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.040
What am I supposed to do now?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.840
(Li Zimo, Li family's second son)
Mother, don't cry.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.600
It'll harm your health.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.520
Zixuan.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.600
Don't worry.

Zixuan!

You left no heirs,

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.400
so you can entrust the family business

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.680
to Zimo!

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.160
Go peacefully!

They're mostly gone. Come out.

You pushed it yourself?

I'm hungry.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.240
Hungry?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.040
Easy to fix.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:54.720
Here.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.000
I'm hungry too.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.600
Should we eat the offerings?

Why not?

Sweet?

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.720
You heard
the second concubine's words today?

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.960
People

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.440
reveal their true nature

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.240
only when you're in crisis.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.760
Your foolish brother
will inherit everything.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.480
After all these years in this household,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.520
I know what she is thinking best.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.480
Not just second concubine.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.360
This is just the beginning.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.680
Tomorrow,

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.160
you can know it.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.120
The real show will unfold.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.560
Big show.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.920
I'm thirsty.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.920
You're a corpse

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.680
with too many demands.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.360
Be grateful that you get offerings.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.600
I knelt and wailed all day.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.984
So exhausted!

00:13:05.984 --> 00:13:06.784
No food or drink.

00:13:06.784 --> 00:13:07.840
I don't complain,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.000
and now you complain?

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.440
I...

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.880
I don't like apples.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.520
Get up.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.200
Scoot over that way.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.520
Let me lie inside for a bit.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.320
Ah?

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080
What?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.640
I've been kneeling all day.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.720
I'm exhausted.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.480
Enough eating that apple?

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.560
I'll put it back.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.600
Lie down, so I can get in.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.384
Move to the edge.

00:13:36.384 --> 00:13:37.560
Or how else can I get in?

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.360
Sit down. Lie back.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.920
Scoot over a bit more.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.296
Right, a little further.

00:13:47.296 --> 00:13:47.680
Okay?

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.920
Fine. Just stay like this.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.280
Right now, I really want someone

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.400
to give me a full-body massage.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.800
My face...

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.560
Okay.

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.400
Close the lid. The light is blinding me.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.840
Did you get a too small coffin?

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.600
This coffin is meant for one person.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.560
Turn sideways so I can lie down.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.280
Have you ever seen
a corpse lie sideways?

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.240
Corpses don't eat apples.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.640
Move over there.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.656
Just a little.

00:14:22.656 --> 00:14:23.680
I can't move any further.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.240
Stop squeezing.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.680
You're pulling my hair.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.720
Stop tossing around.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.920
You'll attract people.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.800
What if someone does come?

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.800
We'll drag them in here
to sleep with us.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.640
Outrageous.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.240
What did you mean by "massage"?

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.720
Just a massage.

00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:45.680
(Li Manor)

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.960
Mother, I'm telling the truth.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.760
I saw my brother and his wife eating.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.960
Enough with your nonsense!

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.600
Then he even took her into the coffin!

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.280
What?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.520
Someone! Open that coffin!

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.480
Who's this?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.080
(Oh no, I overslept.)

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.120
What are you doing, Wei Xiaotang?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.720
A hundred years' karma
brings two together.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.160
This...

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:28.960
Honey,

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.472
let me follow you in death!

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.760
You! Get her out of there!

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.960
Mother!

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.920
Mother!

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.800
The tea merchants are here

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.440
demanding the tea they ordered.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.416
Go look immediately!
