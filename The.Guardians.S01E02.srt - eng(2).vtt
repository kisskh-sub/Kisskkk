What a surprise!

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.740
Hi, Mr. Zhang.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.100
Hello.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.380
Nice to see you.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.740
It's been so long.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.660
Wish the performance a success.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.100
Welcome, welcome.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.020
Good afternoon.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.460
Hey, nice to see you.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.210
[Manager Ma, Municipal Council]
You're so beautiful.

Have a nice day.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.540
You too.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.180
Hi, Ms. Ma.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.740
Hello, Ms. Xian.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.660
Please have a seat.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.850
They're all old friends
from the Municipal Council.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.380
Maybe someday,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.220
the Empire of Japan

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.940
will take over the Municipal Council

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.060
and run the Public Concession.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.130
When that happens,

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.660
Ms. Xian, I hope

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.220
you'll show me the same kindness.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.980
Mr. Takeda, you're joking.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.660
I'm hardly that influential.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.660
In this Concession,

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.820
luck always comes and goes.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.260
It's just like a play on stage,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.570
you always need the understudies ready

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.570
in case something happens.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.890
If there's food, everyone eats.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.130
Wouldn't you agree?

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.660
Only those without scars

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.890
will mock someone else's pain.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.600
Look, what's shining in that window?

[Long Er, actor, Chaosheng Troupe]

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.340
We're all actors.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.100
We can't hide anyone here.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.260
What's shining in that window?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.570
Where's Juliet?

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.570
Move, please.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.980
Hongyu should go first.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.060
Sir, check me first, I need to perform.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.980
Let the sun rise.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.540
Beautiful sun, show yourself.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.380
Chase away that envious moon.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.940
Keep the show going.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.780
Shh.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.780
Don't break character, it's risky.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.780
Close the door.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.780
Her student is prettier than she is.

Sir, we're running out of time.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.340
Sir, I'm begging you.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.460
I need to get on stage soon.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.610
Why is it still dark?

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.900

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.100

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.460
is speaking.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.780
Ah.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.100
Blood.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.020
It's flowing out.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.660
Still has a scent.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.220
No one found over there.

Mr. Takeda.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.140
Is the search done?

The play's not over yet.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.580
I'll watch a bit longer.

Look back!

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.020
Outside the tree, it's bleeding.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.020
It's not easy to climb up here.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.140
Look down.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.780

let them see, I don't care.

The one I'm looking for is here.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.340
He may not be your sidekick,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.900
but if you start running...

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.900
No need to run. Right here!

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.700
You can't change Shakespeare's script.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.580
Now, die.

Would you let go of that grudge

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.780
and run away with me?

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.020

Where is the car?

Afu, you guys go ahead.

Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.130
What's going on?

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:34.490
That tree...

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.700
Stop asking so much.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.490
Don't ask anymore!

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.980
Step back.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.580
Come out.

Congrats on the show, everyone.

Sir,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.260
it was urgent just now.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.140
I pointed a gun at you.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.740
Sorry.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.810
But,

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.260
your quick reaction just now...

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.140
Hongyu, what are you doing?

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.890
He got us in trouble.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.260
Bro, you can't die on me.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.570
If you die, I...

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.330
Stay with me.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.290
What will I do if you're gone?

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.290
Take care of the body.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.260
Wait till later tonight.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.890
Don't let anyone see.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:53.770
Scared?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.650
Then I'll send someone else.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:57.740
Not scared.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:58.860
I'll do it.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.220
Tie both of them up.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.380
Take them to the basement.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:06.890
Alright.

Okay.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.290
Once this mess is cleaned up,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.770
I'll question them myself.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.020
Alright.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:36.930
Wake up.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.340
You'll never crack my cipher.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.050
Let's reveal the answer in hell.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.020
My... cipher

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.660
will haunt you

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.450
for...

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.940
the rest of

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.210
your life.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.170
When did you wake up?

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.290
You really scared me.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.530
Thank goodness, really.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.570
Glad you woke up.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.050
Come on, get up.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:19.650
Tell me,

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.500
where's the antidote?

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.170
My hands and feet are numb now.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.290
Feels like poison's everywhere.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.050
Give me the antidote, quick.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.100
Who bandaged me up?

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.740
Ms. Xian told them to help you.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:34.930
Our troupe

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.410
only had one dose of sulfa left

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.290
and we gave it all to you.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.690
See how well we treated you.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.050
Now we're even, right?

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.410
Hurry, give me the antidote.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.690
We're running out of time.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.170
Tell her thank you for me.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.740
Wait, stop messing around.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.500
Come on, just hand over the antidote.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.170
I was lying to you.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.380
That wasn't a needle.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.460
It was a cufflink.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:53.860
Poison?

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.570
Just kidding.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.260
Ding Yi.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:02.020
Ding Yi.

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.890
Hey, Hongyu,

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:05.170
any news?

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.170
What did Ms. Xian say?

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.530
You're in big trouble now.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:11.650
What are you doing?

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.260
Ms. Xian tied me up. You dared untie it?

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.530
It's safer to keep it tied.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.050
Yeah.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:18.650
Hey, miss.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:21.410
Did you knock me out earlier?

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.410
Ding Yi, you must be hungry.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.860
Sir,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.020
want to have one too?

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:31.860
I'll skip it for now.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:32.740
What time is it?

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.650
It's past midnight.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.650
Do you have a phone here?

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:36.810
Yeah.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.810
What's up?

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.260
Could you help me out?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.140
I'll give you a number.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.020
Can you call it for me?

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.050
Tell the person who answers,

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.140
get to customs before sunrise

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.810
set up a British passport record,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.410
use my photo for it,

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.140
and name it as Charlie Gu.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.170
There's a phone, yes.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.820
It's in Biyun's office.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.050
Right.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.420
I need her okay first.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.170
That's true.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.770
Listen,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:06.850
if you're any slower,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.420
Ding Yi won't make it.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.890
He told the Japanese I'm his assistant

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.140
who just got back to China.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.650
The Japanese will check for sure.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.050
Wait any longer and it's too late.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.050
The Cipher Section Manager of MSS
was here.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.530
Ding Yi's really made a scene.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.050
We need to tell them
what happened today.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.140
Alright.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.410
I'll leave as soon as it's light out.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.860
As for the one with Ding Yi,

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:42.650
Biyun!

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.770
How many times have I told you,

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.260
knock before you come in.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.810
Why can't you ever remember?

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:55.690
Sorry, Mr. Wu.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.260
Biyun, can I use the phone?

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:02.810
It's so late.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.290
The basement.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.770
Ding Yi's friend asked me to call.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.930
He needs help with a passport.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.460
The Japanese will check it.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.650
Where does he want to call?

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.740
He didn't say.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.340
He only said,

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.860
if it's late, we'll miss our chance.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:29.720
[Changze Shipyard]

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:47.890
Changze Shipyard.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:55.890
I'm just trying to help you.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.890
Sorry,

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.650
I messed it up.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:09.410
Why are you laughing?

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:10.570
I haven't eaten

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.170
all day.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.570
It's all because of you.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.980
I finally get it now,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.930
you were sent to mess up my life,

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:17.460
right?

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.340
I'm laughing
because your acting is good.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.690
Look at you right now.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.930
You're nothing like you were
with the Japanese.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.570
Your performance was spot on.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.650
That's what I like to hear.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.770
It's true.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.410
I'm a professional actor.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.170
You're that confident in your skills?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.050
Of course I am.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:46.410
Let me put it this way,

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.170
everyone in Shanghai calls me

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.170
Chaplin from Gordon Road, Shanghai.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.890
I, Ding Yi, have three talents,

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:58.410
people skills, mimicry, and memory.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.650
Hand me any script you like.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.770
I'll memorize it right away.

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:04.410
Bring anyone in front of me.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.930
I'll imitate them in no time.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:21.890
So how about this,

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.170
I won't take your job away.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:24.810
I'll actually offer you one.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.410
I'll give you a role.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.650
You'll be the lead role.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.650
So, feeling confident?

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:34.650
What do you mean?

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:35.410
I mean,

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.690
just keep imitating Joseph Lee,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.140
keep playing as him.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:43.170
I won't.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.170
You already said,

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:46.570
Joseph is a traitor.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:47.740
I'm not a traitor.

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.720
Look,

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.650
you helped him before,

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:51.890
and gave lessons to the Japanese.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.260
That does look suspicious, you know.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.530
But I'm different.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.570
I'm with the Anti-Traitor Squad.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.650
If you help me,
you'll be helping us out.

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.260
Still, I won't act in it.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.700
How much did the Japanese pay you?

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.050
Your pay won't be touched.

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.050
On top of that,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.220
I'll double your pay.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.530
That's still not enough.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.290
Well, Ding Yi,

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.220
if the Japanese ever found out

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.050
that the real Joseph Lee is dead,

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.020
and the fake one is in Chaosheng Troupe,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.020
what do you think they'd do?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.530
Gu!

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:32.900
You can mess with me,

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.260
but don't mess with my troupe.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.770
He's one of us.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:43.130
No one can force him.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:47.420
Ms. Xian,

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.850
if the Japanese find out,

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.330
the person they're searching for

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.090
died on your turf,

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.570
what do you think they'll do?

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.900
Then I could toss you
in the Huangpu river.

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.850
No one would know what happened here.

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.130
Ms. Xian, you wouldn't.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.290
Why wouldn't I?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:09.090
Kindness.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.850
I don't care who you are.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.020
If you want to pick on my people,

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.940
you have to

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.980
get through me first.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.530
Ms. Xian,

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.660
I always thought I was the burden here.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.260
Didn't expect you...

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:32.660
Get lost.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.290
No, Ms. Xian,

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.770
that person is too dangerous.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.660
I have to stay and protect you.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.530
Explain how you took side jobs,

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.130
give every detail to Uncle Wu.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:43.900
Also,

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.180
hand over all your side job earnings,

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.370
then I'll decide
if you get a second chance.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:49.290
Leave now.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.570
Got it, got it.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.290
I'm leaving right now.

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.500
I'm going, okay?

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.050
Now we can talk in private.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.020
Who was that dead person?

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.420
Hey, calm down.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.050
I can tell you,

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.090
but before that,

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.330
you have to tell me something too.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.050
How did you deal with

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:47.770
the body and the car?

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.740
Captain Kobayashi, they're here.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.220
There must be

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.020
something off about that box.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:23.530
Hey man,

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.180
give me a hand.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.260
What's inside?

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:44.290
Don't move!

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.770
Don't move.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:48.050
Go take a look.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.530
What are you doing?

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.610
What are you doing?

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.530
We're checking the costumes.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.810
Sir,

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.050
these are all our stage outfits.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.900
That's everything they have.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.810
Ms. Xian, you truly have skills.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.370
Surviving these times,

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.850
you need to look out for yourself.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.940
But honestly, this mess is on me.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.420
I could've just sent my team.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.220
But I don't trust your people.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.180
Ms. Xian, no need

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.810
to shut people out.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.610
We're facing a real threat,

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:56.050
yet you stay cool under pressure.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.090
And you handle a gun well.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.570
You must have your own motives.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.330
I think we'll have more chances

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.370
to work together.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.290
If you want to work with me,

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.810
start by telling me,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.290
who was the person I took care of?

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.370
And also,

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.460
who exactly are you?

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:20.660
Sure.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.610
My last name is Gu.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:23.850
Gu Yangshan.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.770
Just got back from studying abroad.

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.850
The one who died was Joseph Lee.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.090
He was my classmate.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.700
At first, I thought,

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.370
if the offer was good enough,

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:37.050
maybe I could win you over.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.460
But now, that's just impossible.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.570
But Joseph Lee,

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:45.090
if you still work for the Japanese,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.330
and keep being a traitor,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.770
then I guess,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.850
we'll just keep it professional.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.090
Traitor?

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.460
Bro,

I need to clear something up.

Honestly, I know nothing.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.130
I was just helping him

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.850
I just wanted to make money.

I'm not a traitor, really.

Careful, it's hot.

Are you okay?

I've seen it all, trust me.

This is nothing for me.

Not at all.

Don't worry.

But you can't do this again.

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.180
Tonight was way too risky.

It's not like the old days.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.130
Were you scared of going hungry?

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.660
I just wanted to earn a bit more.

Don't worry, I'll listen to you.

I won't do this anymore.

Don't worry.

Ms. Xian can handle anything.

No trouble she can't fix.

Right?

Yeah.

Eat more.

I've eaten them all.

All gone.

I'm the foreman at Changze Shipyard.

I'm here to find Mr. Gu.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:29.810
So, from this situation,

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.050
we draw two conclusions.

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.610
First, Ding Yi really did a great job.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.570
He managed to fool the Japanese.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:36.370

So, what do you want Ding Yi to do?

Ms. Xian,

we're not working together yet.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.940
Since you won't be upfront,

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:55.610
I guess we're not on the same page.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:57.940
Mr. Gu,

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.460

Got it.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.290
Looks like

you're not afraid to upset the Japanese.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.460
Lots of things happened here tonight.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.570
But if you keep quiet,

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:16.940

Commissioner Luo, you may not know this,

make him think the cipher's leaked,

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.540
then have him change it himself.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.540
That's the fastest plan I have.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.420
But this guy isn't Joseph Lee.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.250
Joseph Lee is already gone.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.540
Anyone who knows Joseph Lee

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.900
could easily see through this lie.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.540
Commissioner Luo,

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.250
you don't know Joseph Lee.

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.060
Joseph Lee was born in the UK

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.130
and grew up in the UK.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:31.020
Spent most of his life buried in books.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:32.820
So before he came back,

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:33.980
the only Chinese who knew him

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.020
was me.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.980
But as far as I know,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.980
Joseph Lee returned

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.570
quite some time ago already.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.130
Didn't he ever show up in public?

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.460
Actually, he never did.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.730
Because he knew working for the Japanese

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:47.980
could put his life at risk.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.090
So over the past few months,

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.610
he never appeared publicly at all.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.650
He didn't even allow

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:53.650

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:54.500
to enter his room.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.340
So most people believe,

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:59.380
Ding Yi is the real Joseph Lee.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.540
Excuse me.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.460
can I say something here?

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.380
Honestly, I think,

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:13.940
this plan might be worth a shot.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:22.420
The catch is, Ding Yi isn't our guy.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.860
If the plan fails,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.020
it's just cannon fodder lost.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.380
It won't affect us at all.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.420
But if it works out,

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.420
this could turn everything around.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.060
It's a smart move.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.980
It's the perfect chance to win big,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.380
a great opportunity for us.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.170
Why not give it a try?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:09.980
Right hand, right hand.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.900
Which side? This side?

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.690
Yeah, this way.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.460
Move up a bit.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.250
Is Xian Biyun really that impressive?

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.060
She started at sixteen

00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.540
and began playing maids.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.170
Now she's a top name in Shanghai.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.900
But she chose to retire at her peak.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.130
After her retirement from acting,

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.940
she formed the Chaosheng Troupe.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.650
People are still guessing

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.650
why she did it.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.860
Does she have support behind the scenes?

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.170
I've looked into

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.690
all her film investors early on.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:41.980
Their backgrounds are different.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.380
There's no pattern to it.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:46.500
This troupe runs only
on its own revenue.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.940
It's straightforward and clean.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.340
Can we go in and have a look?

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.860
Young Master,

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.540
this is the Public Concession.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:02.500
Xian Biyun knows everyone
at the Municipal Council.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:03.980
Every time she performs,

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.420
a lot of foreigners come to watch.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:08.020
That's why Takeda won't mess

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.610
with her shows.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:13.290
Perfect.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:17.130
Fine.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.540
If force doesn't work,
we'll play it smart.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.020
She's a woman,

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.250
and over twenty people rely on her.

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:25.500
She may not have any weaknesses,

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.020
but she must have her troubles.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.650
Bless Chaosheng Troupe with full houses.

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:31.770
Full houses every show.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:32.900
Full houses every show.

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.980
Ms. Xian.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.540
Ms. Xian.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.460
Ms. Xian.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.540
You're back.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.540
Here's our encore performance poster.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:50.900
Let's go.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.960
[Romeo and Juliet; Encore Date: June 23]

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.090
I've got a plan.
