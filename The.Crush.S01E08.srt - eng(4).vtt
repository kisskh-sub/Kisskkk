(Competition and Reverse)

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.960
Take it slow.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.520
Don't spill it.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.400
Put it here.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.920
Got it.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.280
What are you doing here?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.800
Since you don't want to please Niaoniao,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.880
I have to figure out my way.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.160
What is it?

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.200
This is it.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.000
Milk?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.120
I'll make you something

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.120
you've never tasted before.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.960
It's delicious.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.120
Today, the Haiqing Tea Competition

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.960
will judge based on

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.400
(Haiqing County Magistrate)

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.640
color, aroma, and flavor.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.360
Let the Haiqing Tea Competition

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.560
begin!

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.160
A1 candidate: Zhao's Tea Estate.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.000
The tea looks clear and vibrant.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.040
The texture is smooth,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.880
with a lingering aftertaste.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.600
D2 candidate: Jiang's Tea Estate.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.800
Master Zimo, look at that.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.720
What did she put in?

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.120
Roasted rice?

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.920
Never seen that before.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.880
While distinctive in flavor,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.680
it's just some trick.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.480
It is not fit for nobles.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.720
C2 Candidate:
Laoshan Zheng's Tea Estate.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.960
B2 Candidate:
Jiangling Chang's Tea Estate.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.120
C1 Candidate: Wang's Tea Estate.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.480
Your Niaoniao's turn.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.840
Absurd.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.720
Wang's tea-making technique

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.320
prioritizes rich aroma
and mellow texture.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.320
Please behold.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.760
It's the same trick

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.160
from Tianxiang Tea House.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.040
Had our tea not been ruined,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.280
we wouldn't need you to take risks.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.640
The technique is truly remarkable.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.760
Tea looks clear as azure sky,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.520
froth white as moonlight,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.400
flavor both lingering and sweet.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.960
Painting landscapes in a teacup,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.600
such a skill is hard to master.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.960
One might mock Lu Hongjian,

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.240
who built fame through tea brewing.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.672
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:05.720
Wang's, amazing!

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.600
- Indeed!
- Absolutely!

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.800
I think such technique

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.840
could rank top

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.880
in this competition.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.720
A2 Candidate: Li's Tea Estate.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.920
Don't push yourself.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.040
You saw that.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.160
Tricks won't work.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.440
At worst, we'll try again next year.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.000
Trust me.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.600
Don't worry.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.120
Why Li's Tea Estate

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.720
sent Madam Li to compete?

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.480
She might embarrass herself.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.520
Li's Tea Estate.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.000
- Exactly!
- Right.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.400
Enough talk.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.720
Taste matters the most.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.760
Madam Li isn't brewing or whisking...

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.000
She...

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.280
What's she doing
with that boiling water?

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.600
I can tell

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.600
she knows no tea-making technique.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.360
Since Senior Li died,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.480
the Lis have no one competent?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.720
How could they send

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.040
a young madam to compete?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.360
What a joke!

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.800
I thought you had any good idea.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.360
How can you let your wife

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.880
embarrass the Lis like this?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.880
I trust her.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.880
The Li's Milk Tea is complete!

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.240
Milk tea?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.200
Shut your mouth!

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.880
- Enough! Shut up!
- Shut up!

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.880
It can't taste good.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.520
Look at that bizarre color!

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.880
Novices won't do well.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.640
Is this even drinkable?

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.160
What does it taste like?

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.440
Madam Li,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.800
your tea shows some froth,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.040
but it looks murky and pale.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.200
I wonder what you've put in.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.480
Why is it in this color?

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.760
Are you sure this tea is drinkable?

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.760
Could it be poisonous?

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.240
Magistrate.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.240
We drink tea for centuries,

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.760
yet always stick to tradition,

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.960
with no innovation.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.040
My Li's Milk Tea is innovative.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.400
We dare to pursue innovation.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.680
You!

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.440
Why are you coming up here?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.000
If you have concerns,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.160
let me taste it first.

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.240
Guys,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.520
any questions?

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.920
This tea carries rich creaminess
upon first sip,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.240
unlike traditional milk tea.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.880
It offers unique charm.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.920
Magistrate...

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.480
The tea ceremony is over

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.360
and voting has ended.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.280
Everyone,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.680
Haiqing has centuries of tea tradition,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.640
is known to the world.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.040
Today's offerings are all exquisite,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.760
granting us supreme enjoyment.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.640
However, it is a competition,

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.040
then ranks must be made.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.840
The tea that Wang's Tea Estate offered

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.280
excels in technique

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.320
and quality,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.480
earning top-tier recognition,

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.000
unlike traditional milk tea.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.840
Yet today,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.320
the winner is not them.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.480
I was born in Haiqing.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.640
Like you all,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.320
I'm busy in trifles

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.600
and official duties.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.520
I've spent half my life

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.240
within these hundred miles.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.240
Therefore,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.960
I am still

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.720
short-sighted.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.480
Today, what Li's Tea Estate offered

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.120
blends creaminess with freshness,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.960
with a lingering aftertaste.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.080
It transports us

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.720
beyond our confines,

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.240
to witness northern frontier's scenery.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.600
This is the tea's true essence.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.640
The supreme tea in Haiqing!

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.840
- Good!
- Good!

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.240
- Magnificent!
- Well done!

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.600
- Good!
- Good!

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.960
Madam is amazing!

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.400
Madam Li,

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.200
what's this tea called?

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.880
Magistrate, this is called Li's Hey Tea.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.800
Good!

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.400
Perfect name!

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.080
For such a joyous occasion,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.200
let's call it Happy Tea.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.840
Happy Tea!
