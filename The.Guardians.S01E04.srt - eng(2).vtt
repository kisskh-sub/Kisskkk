[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 4]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.760
[Maxin Theatre]

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.740
The code of Joseph Lee

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.460
is extremely difficult to decipher

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.380
because he used a set

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.540
of extremely complex

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.260
functions

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.980
to encrypt the information.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.740
Even if the plaintext is the same,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.020
the encrypted ciphertext

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.020
would still be different.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.410
Therefore,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.900
just by intercepting

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.260
the existing ciphertext

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.100
is simply not enough

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.820
to figure out his encryption pattern.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.540
We call this model "one-time pad".

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.820
I know that.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.900
One-time pad.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.980
So that means

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.850
we have to calculate every day?

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:10.260
Yes.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.660
The computation load
for one-time pad is huge.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.380
So he needs to train a large number of

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.500
cipher specialists

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.660
and send them to various units

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.380
that use this cipher system.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.100
This is also what you

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.980
are helping Joseph Lee with.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.100
However,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.980
Manager, don't worry.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.260
I have already learned

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.220
the core algorithm

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.540
of his cipher system.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.380
The key is also

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.260
in our own hands.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.780
Even if he's gone,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.220
I can still guarantee this cipher system

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.220
will run smoothly.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.540
So what do you want me to do?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.980
Next time you go to the MSS for class,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.540
tell Takeda

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.780
you want to bid him farewell.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.540
Farewell?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.380
Yes.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.820
Tell Takeda

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.660
you heard from the British

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.380
that the code you designed for him
has been leaked

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.540
and thus you don't want to work
for the Japanese anymore.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.540
Also, suggest that he replace
this cipher with a new one.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.380
That's it?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.780
Just with a few words?

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.660
The Japanese aren't fools.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.780
I say a few sentences

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.980
and they'll believe and replace it?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.820
Don't worry, we're not fools either.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.220
I'll arrange an operation

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.660
to make the Japanese believe you.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.820
Wait a second.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.940
If Joseph Lee is cooperating
with the enemy forces,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.780
can you ensure the absolute
security of the cipher?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.780
Well...

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.500
But if he is an enemy spy,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.380
then why would he give us

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.340
a brand-new encryption system?

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.780
This algorithm

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.540
allowed us to immediately escape
enemy reconnaissance

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.940
and be invincible in
the northern Jiangsu battlefield

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.500
I need to find out
what exactly happened to him

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.300
in the past few days.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.170
Search his room
at the Metropolitan Hotel

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.100
secretly and thoroughly.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.980
Leave no trace.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.020
Also, assign more personnel

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.260
to keep a close watch
on William's Residence.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.700
But inside William's Residence...

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.580
It's true that you can't get in

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.620
the British director's territory
and search it.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.740
But I

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.380
might have a way
to get you in to take a look.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.260
Answer me a question.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.380
How did you remember the things

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.260
Joseph Lee taught you so perfectly?

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.380
Is it that hard?

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.580
What learning steps
did Joseph Lee teach you?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.740
What steps?

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.620
None at all.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.380
Every time he just gave me a problem,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.940
then told me the correct solution.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.380
I memorized it, that's all.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.820
And you memorized them all?

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.940
Didn't I tell you before?

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.620
I, Ding Yi,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.820
people skills, mimicry,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.700
and great memory.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.580
You forgot that?

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.380
These here

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.580
are all the questions
for your next class at the MSS.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.620
How long will you need?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.620
If I have to both memorize
and write it down,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.620
a few hours, I guess.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.940
Memorizing is easy.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.940
The hard part is writing.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.580
Alright.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.820
Then we start the timer now.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.320
[A few hours later]

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.260
The end.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.250
Wake up, class is over.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.940
So, what do you think?

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.820
Are you satisfied with this grand show?

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.500
I finally understand

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.940
why Joseph Lee chose you.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.380
Looks like we bet on the right horse.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.820
What do you think, Commissioner Luo?

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.820
This time you should be
willing to serve him, right?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.940
When you write things, don't be so...

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.140
Fast.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.940
Got it?

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.820
There needs to be a process of thinking.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.500
Otherwise, without thinking,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.500
it just looks like rote memorization.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.820
Do you know what a genius is?

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.820
A genius doesn't need to think.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.380
You still have...

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.940
Young Master.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.740
Uncle Gu.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.940
Ms. Xian from Chaosheng Troupe is here.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.180
She specifically asked to see you.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.260
See me?

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.580
Welcome, Ms. Xian.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.740
What brings you to me?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.500
Back then, the place
I originally wanted to rent

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.380
was this Maxin Theatre.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.180
Unfortunately, my purse was light

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.820
and I couldn't fulfill my wish.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.820
Such twists of fate.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.140
Last time, I wanted
to repay your kindness

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.820
but you didn't accept it.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.060
How did you know I was here?

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:00.620
I guessed.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.820
Nowadays, in the Bund of Shanghai,

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.060
Ding Yi is like a ticking time bomb.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.940
You wouldn't take him to your workplace,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.620
nor would you bring him home.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.380
So I guessed that this place,
close and safe,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.820
must be the one.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.380
Ms. Xian truly

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.260
is smart and quick-witted.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.380
Listen.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.260
Give me three days.

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:35.770
After three days,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.500
Maxin Theatre will be at your disposal.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.860
The wife of Director William

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.140
has invited me to William's Residence
at 7 PM tonight

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.980
to attend their farewell banquet.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.860
And what does that have to do with me?

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.020
The Japanese spies

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.260
have already spotted
Joseph Lee's car at William's Residence.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.860
I see.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.620
Thank you for the notice, Ms. Xian.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.380
Rest assured.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:04.860
Joseph Lee

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.260
will definitely appear
at the banquet tonight.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.860
But I'd like to ask you for a favor.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.380
Talk to Mrs. William a bit

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.020
and make sure she sticks to the story

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.740
that Joseph Lee has been
staying at their house.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.740
I've already informed you,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.740
which is kind enough.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.020
Well then.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.260
May I ask what I can do for you?

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.620
Take good care of Ding Yi.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.460
Tonight at six,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.620
I'll drive over to pick you up.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.140
What's the use of your good memory

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.500
if you don't understand
the meaning behind them?

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.620
Don't you not understand either?

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.620
What I understand, you can't.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.620
What I know, you may
not necessarily know.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.020
I don't need to know.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.260
I just need to memorize.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.500
Just memorizing
is definitely not enough.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.500
The plan has changed.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.340
Takeda found Joseph Lee's car

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.340
inside William's Residence.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.380
So tonight he will send Japanese

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.100
to William's Residence

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.140
to attend Mrs. William's banquet.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.740
The goal is to see
whether Joseph Lee is there.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.100
So you must attend

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.380
tonight's banquet.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.020
Wait, wait a minute.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.260
Banquet?

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.860
Yes, and I can only tell you,

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.620
this banquet will be much harder
than the questions you memorized.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.380
Ding Yi.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.340
If you were only

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.260
memorizing the lessons
Joseph Lee gave you,

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.260
then tonight you can't just imitate him.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.140
You have to truly become Joseph Lee.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.860
The real play is starting
ahead of schedule.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.800
[7 hours before the banquet]

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:21.740
Don't trouble them.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.620
It fits.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.620
Can't we button this?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.380
The front button of a tuxedo
should not be fastened.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.140
It's too big.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.140
You have to fix it.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.260
Alright.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.460
What are you doing?

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.380
Besides that,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.860
grooming is also an essential part

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.860
of being a true English gentleman
like Joseph Lee.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.260
That's so charming.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.380
After putting on this bespoke suit,

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.100
you resemble the Joseph Lee I know

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.620
even more.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.380
If you want to be Joseph Lee,

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.460
just the outfit

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.980
and your acting skills

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.100
are not enough.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.380
What are you doing?

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.220
Remember, when wearing a tuxedo,

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.810
never tuck the vest into the trousers.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.050
And between the vest and trousers,

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:06.570
your shirt must never show.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.690
If tailoring a suit is like

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.220
building a skyscraper
from the ground up,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.460
then the crowning touch

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.690
is the cufflinks.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.220
Joseph Lee

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.810
always wanted to join the International
Mathematicians Association,

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.340
so he had a pair of cufflinks
made in imitation.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:24.690
As it happens,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.810
I received an invitation
from this association.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.500
So my cufflinks are genuine.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.810
Great.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.220
I care for them intimately.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:34.810
But today I'll let you use them.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.100
Take a look.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.930
So that's it.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.980
Joseph Lee's were fakes.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.220
Didn't expect you intellectuals
to be this vain.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:46.340
You're no better than me.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.570
What do you mean "you intellectuals"?

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:51.570
Take it.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.220
Fine.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.340
Us intellectuals.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.480
[Less than 3 hours before the banquet]

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.690
I must say,

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.570
you do pull off the blind act
quite convincingly.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.530
Charlie.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.500
You flatter me.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:25.410
Alright, alright.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.340
Stop acting now.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.930
Save your performance for tonight.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.570
Yes, it is quite tiring.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.570
I'll do it myself, Uncle Gu.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.290
No need to be so polite.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:40.690
Hold on.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.220
This is a napkin, not a bib.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.460
The proper way to use a napkin

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.810
is to fold it in half

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.570
and lay it flat across your laps.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:51.690
Enjoy your meal.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:55.500
Enjoy your meal.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:07.100
Wait a minute.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.100
Dining etiquette.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.290
Never do things

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.860
you shouldn't do yourself.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.100
Sit properly.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.460
Angus ribeye.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.930
Joseph Lee had this dining habit.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.980
Each time, he has exactly 150 grams.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.100
Not a gram more, not a gram less.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.220
150 grams of beef every meal?

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.340
That's extravagant.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:38.930
Excuse me,

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.570
but look at all that blood.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.050
This isn't cooked, right?

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.050
How do you eat it raw like this?

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.340
I'm not eating this.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.690
I'll get diarrhea afterwards.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.810
I'll have yours instead.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.810
I'll take yours.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.810
Snails?

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:56.810
French escargot.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.170
Mine doesn't have blood,
want to try it?

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.080
[Less than 30 minutes
before the banquet]

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.050
Let's drink somewhere else.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.100
Let's drink somewhere else.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.620
Where's Mr. Gu?

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.340
Let's drink elsewhere.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.170
Mr. Gu, didn't know

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.930
you're so careless about rules.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.050
We're about to start the operation,

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:51.860
and you're so drunk like this?

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.200
[Half an hour earlier]

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.690
It's about time.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.930
Is it done?

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:09.410
Almost.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.460
I really can't bring myself to eat this.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:14.500
Put it down.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.570
If you really can't stand Western food,

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.740
then when we get to the banquet,

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.410
stay a little further away
from the buffet area.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.930
I'll find a quiet spot for you

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:21.690
to sit down.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:22.810
Alright, I got it.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:23.810
Buffet.

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.690
Buffet, buffet area.

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:27.050
Oh, and

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.290
speaking of language,

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.170
you must be careful.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.740
Once we get there,
there will definitely be

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.570
a lot of foreigners.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.410
Try your best not to speak.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.290
If you want to say something,

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.410
I'll speak on your behalf.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.050
It's fine.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.170
I can speak, I can.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.460
You forgot? I'm an actor.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.690
I've performed every one
of Shakespeare's plays.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.690
I know them all by heart.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.810
Plus, Joseph Lee taught me
a few lines before.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.170
That's enough to handle them.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.410
Are you sure you've actually
acted in Shakespeare,

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.570
and not just peeked at the script?

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:55.570
You...

00:16:59.190 --> 00:16:59.620
Don't worry about it.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.220
Anyway, I can speak.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.930
Ignore him, let's talk business.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.180
So, I won't eat anything at all,

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.940
and just watch others eat?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.850
Mr. Lee,

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:10.420
you can't see.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:14.940
How's your drinking capacity?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.700
At the banquet,
I'll get you a glass of wine,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.180
so you don't feel awkward.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.850
Now that's an awkward question.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:24.700
Don't be fooled by my small frame,

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.940
I'm basically a walking wine cellar.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.180
A pound or two is just rinsing my mouth,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.980
three or four pound
don't even count as drinking.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.260
But the way you poured this wine
is all wrong.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.420
It's insulting to fill a teacup

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:38.940
to the brim.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.260
But wine should be poured full
to show respect.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:42.900
Got it?

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:43.940
Let me taste it.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:48.770
No.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.180
You absolutely can't drink this way.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.130
You'll get drunk easily.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.420
Let him drink it.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.180
It's sweet and sour.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.130
Maybe he'll knock out a few Japanese.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.940
That'd be a gain for us.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.130
Now that

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:00.460
hits me right in the heart.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.420
Come on, bro.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.900
Just for those words,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.460
I'll drink them under the table!

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.460
Alright, alright.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.370
I know you can drink, okay?

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.180
But can you save your capacity

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.180
for tonight?

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.900
That's not even close yet.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.660
Don't worry, I can drink.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.850
If friends and family ask about me,

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:23.370
I'll

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.660
finish this bottle before we talk!

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.610
Young Master.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.260
Ms. Xian's car has arrived.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.420
It's waiting at the back door.

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.090
Alright.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.900
Mr. Gu.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:43.460
Sit.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.260
Why didn't you keep an eye on him?

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.770
How about we cancel the operation?

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:53.660
He's this drunk.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.090
He'd confess everything to the Japanese.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.660
At this point,
it's impossible to cancel.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.900
When we get there,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.180
if he's still like this,

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.420
I'll pour him a few more drinks first.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.090
No way.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.370
Your wine won't stop my mouth.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.370
What I should say, I'll say it all.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.850
Mrs. William finally agreed to help.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.020
If we betray her trust this time,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.420
it'll be even harder in the future.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.330
Too hard.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:28.370
Ding Yi.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.570
Isn't this

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.900
Juliet?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.180
Is this...

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.660
I'm telling you, Juliet.

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.460
You'd better keep

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.260
the rose I gave you safe, you hear?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.700
Ms. Xian, you've finally came.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.020
Mrs. William is waiting for you.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.770
Please tell Mrs. William

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.130
I'll be there right away.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.700
Ding Yi, we're here. Wake up.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.610
That startled me awake.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.700
Feeling any better?

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.940
Just a bit nauseous,

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.130
but not too dizzy anymore.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.180
How about you?

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.420
Not too dizzy, just a bit nauseous.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.420
It's about time.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.330
We should head in.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.580
I'll go find Mrs. William.
You watch him.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:30.890
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:32.420
Don't worry, I've got this.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:33.900
Let's go.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.370
Wait a sec.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.370
Where are the glasses?

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.420
Didn't I give them to you?

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.130
When did you give them to me?

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.610
When we were drinking.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.540
These aren't mine, right?

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.300
They're mine.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.300
Wear them.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:58.740
Let's go.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.170
Hello.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.370
Long time no see.
You've become prettier.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.650
You look beautiful tonight as well.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.740
Thank you.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:30.540
Hi.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.260
Hi, Ms. Xian, long time no see.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.940
Mr. Zhang, long time no see.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.460
Hello.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:37.980
Hello.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.700
You've become prettier.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.300
They're here.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:45.370
Biyun's here.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:46.300
Biyun.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.810
Coming right away.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:50.460
Hurry up here.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.060
Peter!

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.170
Ms. Xian.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.370
You're abandoning me so soon?

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.460
Hi, Cindy.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.220
Hi, Biyun.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:22.980
Madam been waiting for you.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.370
Sorry.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.130
Sorry.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.740
Madam William.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.540
I apologize for not being able to attend
the opening of the banquet today.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.410
It's okay.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.370
Where's Mr. William?

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.980
His eye disease has occurred,

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.890
so he went back to rest.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.220
I'm so sorry to hear that.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.370
Thank you.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.300
You're welcome.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:52.460
Can I have some water?

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.460
My chest feels hot.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.700
I'll find you a place to sit first,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.700
then get you some water.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.300
Have a seat, Mr. Lee.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.130
Alright.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.460
I'll get you some water.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.170
Okay.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.700
A little slower. Play along.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.740
Why is she here?

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.220
Aren't they supposed to be here?

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.460
Otherwise, why would we be here?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.460
Didn't you see there were three of them?

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.300
That girl is Meng Jie.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.980
Her father is Meng Mingyi,
Deputy Director of the Health Agency.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.220
He's had dealings with my father.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:08.700
Meng Jie and I...

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.980
I get it, I get it.

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.650
But she should be in Chongqing.

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:14.500
Why would she be here?

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:21.060
Looks like Meng Mingyi

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.170
has become a collaborator with Japan.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.460
Just cooperate a little longer.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.610
I'm really tired today,

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.370
I've been acting with you all the time.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.300
Just hold on.

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.610
But Meng Jie looks really nervous.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:33.980
It's like Kobayashi and Kondo

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.940
forced her to come.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.060
Can we not study others for now?

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.370
Can you pay attention to me instead?

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.500
I'm about to throw up here.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.890
Bear with it a little longer.

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:42.740
Once Kondo and Kobayashi

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.500
confirm Joseph Lee is at this banquet,

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.980
our act will be over.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.220
How about we go over first

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.810
and greet them ourselves?

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.700
In your state? How?

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.220
Don't look around.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.700
You're blind.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:11.740
You want?

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.740
No, thanks.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.220
Mr. Kondo, let's head back.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:37.940
Wait a moment.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.740
I feel like something is off.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:42.700
Go to the restroom.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.740
Stop staring. To the restroom.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.700
Shixian, Shixian.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:55.890
Shixian.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:57.890
Shixian.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.500
Sorry, Miss.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.460
Sorry.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.500
Are you alright?

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.460
Apologies.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.220
Sorry for spilling on you.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.740
Mr. Lee, I knocked a young lady down.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.410
Alright, quickly go help her.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.460
Are you alright?

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.260
I'll help.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.980
Here, get up.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:14.980
Come.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:15.980
Shixian.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:16.460
Yes.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.260
It's really my fault.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.460
Sorry, Miss.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.220
Mr. Lee.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:28.740
You are...

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.220
Kondo Saburo.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.700
You're here too.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.130
Here.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.940
Did you sprain your ankle?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:37.700
I didn't...

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:40.460
Mr. Lee, this young lady
sprained her ankle.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.460
I'll escort her out and be right back.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.130
Go ahead.

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.170
I can manage here by myself.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:46.170
Alright.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.940
This is so romantic.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.940
Yellow River's water
flows toward the east.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.810
A daughter in Luoyang
was named Mochou.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.940
At age 13, Mochou could weave brocade.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.940
By 14, she picked mulberry
at south path.

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:23.700
When 15, she was housewife of Lu family.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.540
Shixian.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.460
Mrs. William, take a look.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.170
They're dancing so happily.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.220
I think you should also
go down and join them.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.700
Excuse me.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.170
Biyun.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.700
Ye Yin.

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:09.940
Mr. Lee.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.370
Mr. Takeda has been looking for you.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:14.740
These days...

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.700
Are you alright?

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.460
I'm fine.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.740
Let's go to the restroom.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:42.220
Miss.

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.610
Miss.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:46.650
Which car is yours?

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.410
That one.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.980
Alright.

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.650
Mr. Takeda has arrived.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.410
I always think back to

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.810
the days we filmed movies together.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.060
So many years have passed,

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.700
and you're still so beautiful.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.060
I'm nothing like Mrs. Liang,

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:23.460
with such good fortune

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.220
to have married a fine man.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.700
How are things with Liang?

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.650
Well, for him,

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.460
I have nothing to complain about.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.890
It's just those jerks
from the BIS

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.170
sent Liang to Suzhou as a section chief

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.060
with their sweet talk,

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.980
but gave him a cold shoulder.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.260
How could that happen?

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.220
Then Mr. Liang...

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.460
Forget it, let's drop it.

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.170
You know what he's like.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:01.170
He's not one for fighting and killing.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.130
And now,

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.940
isn't Chairman Wang promoting
the peace movement in Shanghai?

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.650
It's just what Liang wanted.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.170
Since he can't come himself,

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:09.460
I went on his behalf.

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:11.220
Yes.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.130
If we can have peace,
who would want war?

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.460
Exactly.

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.170
Just now,

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.890
I heard something from Director William.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.940
Maybe Chairman Wang
might be interested in it.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.170
Biyun, come here.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.740
We'll talk later.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.220
Is Mr. Kondo still here?

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:20.940
I'm right behind you.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.130
I'm sorry

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:29.700
for today.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.650
It's fine.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.890
Tonight,

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.300
I have no other work arrangements.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.220
Do you have a towel?

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.700
Right in front of you.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.220
I forgot.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.130
You can't see things.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.130
Mr. Lee.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.740
Do you like

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:08.610
eating snails?

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:15.650
Don't mention snails to me again.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.940
I hate them.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.940
Miss, I'm truly sorry for today.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:23.890
My master is still inside
waiting for me.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.060
I'll excuse myself first.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.940
Miss, is there anything else?

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.890
Name card.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.480
[Dr. Meng Jie, Praxis Dr. Schwarz]

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.020
This is where I work.

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:48.890
I'm there during the day.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.020
You can come find me anytime.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.020
Alright then, Miss Meng.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.020
I'm sure fate will let us meet again.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.940
Goodbye.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.420
Mr. Lee, where are you going?

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.290
I'm going to find Mrs. William.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.650
We didn't finish our conversation
from yesterday.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.250
Mr. Lee, are you alright?

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.860
Mr. Lee.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:19.900
Let me go!

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.060
I can't see. Can't you see either?

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.060
There's something on the floor.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.060
Why didn't you warn me?

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:27.380
I'm truly sorry.

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:28.540
Mr. Lee.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:30.730
Stop following me.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.900
Get out! Get out!

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:34.820
Yes.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:38.420
Mr. Lee, your suit.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.250
Wait.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.210
Stop pretending.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:01.130
You can see.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.020
What are you talking about?

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.060
I hate it the most

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.770
when people joke about
my eye condition!

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.090
Just now, to test you,

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.060
I deliberately dropped a cake
in front of you.

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.860
And you

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.060
deliberately tripped over the cake

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.290
to keep up your blind act.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.130
But what you didn't know

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.210
that my real test was

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:36.250
this.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.060
I purposely placed my suit

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:41.020
on top of yours.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.130
If you were blind,

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.860
you would take the top one,

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.130
or at least start feeling

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.340
from the top.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.250
But what did you do?

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.570
To get out of my sight
as quickly as possible,

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.420
you picked out yours,
the one underneath,

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.420
quickly and accurately.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.570
You can't fool me.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.420
How dare you bring a gun to my party!

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.650
Sir, put down your gun, please.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.420
Stay back! Stay back!

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.730
Mr. Lee is Mr. Takeda's guest.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.130
Is it appropriate to point a gun

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.540
at Mr. Lee?

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:45.730
No.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.210
He is our enemy.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:55.940
Charlie.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:00.130
Mr. Lee.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:01.290
No need to get upset.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:02.860
Hold my suit for me first.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.650
Yes, Mr. Lee.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:13.940
Thanks.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.940
Mr. Kondo,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.090
you would kill me just because

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:25.860
I picked the right suit?

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:29.250
Barbarians are always barbarians.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:30.820
It's simply hilarious.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.340
Do you think

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.250
I wouldn't dare kill you?

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.210
Calm down, calm down.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.290
I just want to tell you, Mr. Kondo,

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.250
you don't need eyes to instantly

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:45.770
tell two suits apart.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.940
I believe every gentleman
here could do it,

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.730
except

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.380
you.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.130
Mr. Kondo,

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.500
may I borrow your suit?

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.570
What are you doing?

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.900
Give me your suit.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.650
And I'll give you a satisfying answer.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.340
Mr. Lee, the suit is here.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.770
Every gentleman here knows

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.380
the fabric and weave
matter most to a suit.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.340
The fabric and weave
matter most to a suit.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.500
No matter whether the lines of the suit

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.770
are sharp or delicate,

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:36.940
it all depends on this fabric.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.900
A bespoke suit

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:41.250
is almost always lined
with full canvas.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:42.650
Full canvas is the middle layer.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:43.730
But my suit here

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:44.540
is lined with wool.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.210
Mine is different. It's lined with wool

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.340
and entirely hand-stitched.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.420
In Shanghai, there are only
a few days a year...

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.380
There are only a few days
a year in Shanghai

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.420
with weather perfect for wearing it.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.380
So just by touch, I can recognize

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.540
my own suit.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.610
As for yours,

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:08.610
it has no lining.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:13.570
Shut up!

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:16.420
Don't try to explain.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.730
Just now, you took the suit

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.210
straight out of my hands.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.570
There was no feeling process at all.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.210
Looks like you are observant, Mr. Kondo.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.820
Yes, I didn't exactly feel it carefully,

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.130
because

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.820
my hand touched this

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:36.730
immediately.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.290
Well, excuse me.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.250
I noticed this just now.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:42.650
Look here.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:44.090
There's a hole.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.770
I can tell

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:47.900
it's been mended.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.060
But I can still feel it distinctly.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:57.210
To be Joseph Lee,

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:58.900
you need more than a bespoke suit.

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.130
You need to understand its details.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.770
This is called a boutonnière.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.540
In olden times, European nobles
would use it at ceremonies

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.500
to insert flowers for decoration.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.540
Soldiers would often
unfasten the top button

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.900
and turn down the collar two folds.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.770
This style then passed
into civilian dress.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:18.210
In civilian wear,

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.130
it evolved into the suit lapel

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.500
and retained this buttonhole.

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.730
Tailors in Shanghai
make normal buttonholes.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.730
But those on Savile Row

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.210
prefer to make
Milanese-style boutonnières.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.730
My tailor is even more distinct.

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.250
He has his own unique way

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:35.210
of stitching a boutonnière,

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.540
making it one of a kind in the world.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.770
So just now,
once I touched this boutonnière,

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.420
I naturally took the suit right away.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.730
But I must apologize, Mr. Kondo.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:50.940
I was careless

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.130
and didn't consider the possibility

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:53.900
that your suit might also have been made

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:54.770
by my tailor.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:56.770
I really should have spent more time

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:57.940
to feel carefully

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.860
whether your suit

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:02.130
had a boutonnière.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.770
Mr. Lee, sorry.

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.210
There is no boutonnière
on the lapel of this suit.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.060
That's unfortunate.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.730
Jerk!

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:21.860
What are you doing?

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.020
Who's this Japanese?

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.380
Who allowed the Japanese in?

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.380
Get out.

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:30.650
Get out!

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:34.610
Madam is here.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:37.610
Mr. Lee,

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.340
I am very sorry.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.730
But Mr. Takeda wants to see you.
