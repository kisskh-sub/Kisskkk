=Episode 2=
(The Tea Mistress Laying Down the Rules)

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.560
I'll take my wife back
now to get closer.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.440
I'll have Ning An deliver it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.960
to my mother.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.200
Li Zixuan,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.280
you're quite something.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.600
Judging by this,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.640
there's hope in making the Top Tea

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.200
with you.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.480
Bring me your account books.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.520
Let me check.

00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:42.400
(Li's Tea Estate)

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.920
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.280
This document in my hand

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.800
shows last month's expenses
for the tea estate.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.400
Your monthly wages

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.440
are calculated

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.280
based on how long you've been here.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.840
The longer,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.160
the more you earn.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.880
This system

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.760
caused the tea estate's business

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.800
to decline steadily.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.600
Madam.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.680
Traditionally, we value
loyalty and filial piety.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.320
Those who served Master Li longer

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.400
naturally deserve higher pay.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.680
Do you find this unreasonable, Madam?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.480
As far as I know,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.760
all the work in the tea estate

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.920
is being done by these young workers.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.400
These young employees

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.520
do the most work,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.080
but receive the lowest pay.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.120
Meanwhile, others
flaunt their seniority,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.400
make things difficult
for the young workers.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.760
They don't work,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.960
but keep getting paid more.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.840
Most of the wages

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.520
go to those who don't work.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.960
No wonder the tea estate's business

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.800
keeps worsening.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.160
What do you propose then?

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.680
Starting today,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.800
we will

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.360
calculate work by output

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520
and pay accordingly.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.800
To put it simply,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.040
equal treatment for all.
Work more and get more.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.720
Wait.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.360
Young Master.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.840
This...

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.520
Let me hear more.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.920
This idea is brilliant!

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.560
Exactly!

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.160
Doesn't the Madam know

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.560
women can't do business?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.760
From now on,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.240
we will have four divisions.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.160
Procurement, Sales,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.040
Production and Finance.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.800
Procurement handles
raw material collection.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.440
Sales manages the tea sales.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.920
Production

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.560
processes the tea leaves.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.080
Finance manages all monetary affairs.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.960
This is nonsense!

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.040
I've prepared new contracts

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.840
based on your strengths.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.800
Come collect yours

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.000
by name.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.760
Any questions

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.560
can be discussed with me personally.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.360
This...

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.960
It's not fair.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.200
We devoted ourselves

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.280
to Master Li.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.040
Now we get such meager pay?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.280
We fought alongside Master Li

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.320
to build this estate!

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.040
Is this how his descendants treat us?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.920
Earn based on your work.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.568
That's fair.

00:04:01.568 --> 00:04:02.560
We are motivated!

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.440
Exactly!

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.560
They shouldn't use

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560
their past work

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.600
to Mr. Li to oppress us!

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.440
Right!

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.880
More work means more pay!

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.400
(First, she pointed out
the management flaws)

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.480
(Then she implemented
new policies to win support.)

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.080
(She's quite resourceful.)

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.960
Madam.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.520
Have you left out a contract?

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.200
Support Madam!

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.800
Uncle, you're exempt.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.560
So my arrangement remains unchanged?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.280
Back then, the second concubine
and I came here together.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.440
Technically,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.040
Zixuan has to call me uncle.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.160
Uncle.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.640
I'm afraid you've misunderstood me.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.560
I mean you're fired.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.120
Being fired means termination.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.680
Pack your things and leave immediately.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.120
Exactly.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.120
This is how it should be.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.720
He should've left long ago.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.840
Starting today,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.600
our tea estate will no longer

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.600
tolerate idlers.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.080
As I've just stated,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.880
calculate work by output

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.160
and pay accordingly.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.800
All these years,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.200
at the tea estate,

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.920
you've done minimal work

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.360
while taking the highest pay.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600
Didn't you rely on

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.640
nepotism?

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.440
Moreover, I've heard

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.560
you abused your position

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.040
to embezzle funds.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.720
Don't talk...

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.760
Uncle, don't panic.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.360
I don't mind this little money.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.040
What concerns me is

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.680
that the tea estate's integrity
must be preserved.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.320
I won't let one rotten apple

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.760
spoil the whole bunch.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.280
You!

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.680
Who are you calling a rotten apple?

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.000
Our family expressly forbids

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.360
women from doing business.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.800
Why should we listen to you?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.080
Let's go!

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.280
You're right.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.000
Why listen to you?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.520
Ignore her.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.160
Why should we?

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.840
Everyone.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.680
Don't be ridiculous.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.760
The new rules she said
were authorized by me.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.240
Starting today,

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.360
we will

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.480
operate under these regulations.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.280
Zixuan,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.600
I'm still

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.520
your uncle.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.840
That's inappropriate.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.960
How will you

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.760
explain this to your mother,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.480
right?

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.480
On my wedding night,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.720
you poisoned my wine.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.000
If this matter reaches the yamen,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.000
that will be inconvenient.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.360
What do we do?

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.160
Sir, defend us!

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.360
Move.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.840
Let's go.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.760
Let's go.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.360
It appears

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.960
you understood what I said earlier.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.080
You are not foolish.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.040
I didn't anticipate

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.280
you'd be somewhat useful.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.120
Hold on.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.120
"Somewhat useful"?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.560
Save your compliment.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.440
I'm here to clean up your mess.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.200
Giving you an exit strategy.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.600
Don't reach for the stars

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.680
after getting a foothold.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.600
Cuicui, let's go.

00:07:05.952 --> 00:07:07.360
(Ning An, Li family's servant)

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.160
Young Master,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.800
shall we let the Madam
continue this farce?

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.880
In this tea estate,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.560
everyone shares blood ties with me.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.360
Some words

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.360
are better

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.200
coming from her.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.360
Yes.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.640
Madam's orders, leave with nothing.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.960
Leave now.

00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:44.840
(Li Manor)

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.160
Your actions today

clearly benefit the tea estate.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.920
I observe

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.440
they benefit you more.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.520
You permitted Uncle's expulsion.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.120
Am I right?

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.200
Spare me your righteous posturing.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.320
As for you,

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.000
the Top Tea title.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.720
Leave the tea estate's revival to me.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.400
To restore our tea estate,

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.320
we'll start with tea procurement.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.160
Okay.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:17.920

I'll go with you.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.920
But our family has rules.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.320
Women can't engage in business.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.520
If the tea farmers see you,

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.560
they won't accept it.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.360
I have my ways.

with these ridiculous rules
