00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.000
Hey, Yin Qin.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.080
Which direction is she headed?

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.630
[Yin Qin]
She got on the expressway.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.000
The expressway only has two exits.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.150
I'll take exit A.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:47.000
You take the other one.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.080
Get out.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.030
Who are you people?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.480
Who are you?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:56.150
Move!

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.790
Let go of me!

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.080
[Zhiyan]

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.120
Sorry.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.080
The number you've dialed
is currently unavailable.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.480
Please try again...

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.910
I've never done anything to you.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.960
Why are you doing this?

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:15.030
Do I need a reason?

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.080
Why?

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.510
I just don't like you!

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.360
Hello?

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.240
Say something to your sister!

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.440
Zhizhi, don't come! It's dangerous!

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.390
Don't move!

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.320
You heard it?

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.390
If you're not here soon, your brother
won't be able to speak anymore.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.200
Don't hurt him. I'm on my way.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:38.790
Wait.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.200
Come alone.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.320
Or your brother dies!

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.030
I understand.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.790
How did this happen?

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.510
I rejected Yi Wenhan's proposal.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.790
But everything is still playing out
the same way.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.670
Is there really no way to change fate?

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.440
This time,

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.030
I won't lose any of my family.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.030
Brat.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:14.910
Boss,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.080
I thought we were supposed to take one.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.120
What do you know?

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.360
This one dies.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:22.120
That one's still useful.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.030
The client paid extra.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.150
I get it.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.600
Let me go!

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.510
Stop!

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.200
Zhizhi, you shouldn't have come! Run!

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.390
Zhiyan!

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:35.960
What do you want?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.550
Leave!

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.540
Behave.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.100
You want money, right?

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.300
How much? I'll pay.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.500
No need. We've already been paid.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:52.620
I... I can give you more.

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.980
Just let us go.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.780
I'll give you everything

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.860
in this card.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:13:59.660
Miss,

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.940
we're just paid to do the job.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.140
We don't want any trouble with you.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:08.940
Take your clothes off.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.980
We'll take a few photos,

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.220
some videos,

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.740
and we're done.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.500
But he stays.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.420
Off or not?

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.020
No, huh?

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.900
Then we'll beat you until you do.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.060
Zhizhi, you can't!

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.940
Zhiyan! Zhiyan!

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.260
I'll do it! I'll do it!

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.020
I... I'll take them off.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:33.940
I...

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.020
Go on.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.700
Come on.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.260
Zhizhi, you can't!

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.420
That's more like it.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.380
Miss,

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:58.660
that's not enough.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.580
Keep going.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.100
Come on.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.340

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.420
Don't!

You monsters!

I'll fight you!

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.100
Just kick it away.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.620
Zhiyan, let's go.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.900
Guys, don't let them get away!

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.220
Out of the way!

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.260
Move!

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.140
Go, Zhizhi.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.380

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:21.980
Let's go.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.420
Zhizhi.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:52.940
Get in.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.780
Come on.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.900
No, I can't leave.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.780
He's still in there. I have to help him.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:18.940
Call the police.

You came back for me?

Brother-in-law,

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.940
you're amazing.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.020
Don't call me that.

I got dumped before I even got married.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.740
Thank you for saving us.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:39.780
You're hurt.

[Jinshan Hospital]

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.540
Change the dressing on time.
Keep it dry.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.460
Thank you.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.660
Mr. Ji,

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.300
thank you so much for today.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.620
If you hadn't shown up,

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:23.900
my brother and I...

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:25.780
would have been in serious trouble.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.460
Don't mention it.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.860
I should be thanking both of you.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.980
Let... Let me help you with that.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.940
But it's so late.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.580
What were you doing

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.460
in such a remote area?

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:52.460
Urgent business. I was just passing by.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.980
May I ask what kind

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.100
of urgent business?

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.580
You see,

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.140
you missed your own plans

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.060
to save us.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.380
I want to make it up to you.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.300
Can't. And not necessary.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.020
Mr. Ji,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.340
are you still upset with me?

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.980
Which matter are we talking about?

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.060
Whatever it is,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.460
I had my reasons.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.420
I hope you can understand.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.900
Please forgive me.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.180
You certainly have a lot of reasons.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.380
And they always involve others.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.140
If you hadn't wanted to get involved,

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:31.660
you could have not shown up.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.940
So your appearance tonight
makes me think...

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:34.860
You still suspect me?

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.660
Weren't you just saying

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.820
how terrible things would have been

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.620
if I hadn't shown up?

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.180
You saved my life.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.860
I wouldn't dare suspect you.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.020
Thank you.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:08.100
Alright.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.700
I see.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.140
Who told you to go after Song Zhizhi?

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.140
You've ruined everything!

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.700
It's all destroyed!

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.540
But Mom,

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:25.780
she started it!

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.500
She showed that embarrassing video
of me and Wenhan

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.180
in public.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.860
I just wanted

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:32.620
to get some nude photos

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.060
and videos of her.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.020
Why does she get to do that to me,

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.860
but I can't do it back?

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.260
You're such a fool! So stupid!

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:40.980
I...

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:49.940
Mom.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.540
Well,

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.700
what do we do now?

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.940
What do you think?

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.100
Someone rescued them.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.140
That brat is still alive,

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.260
and Song Zhizhi
is completely unharmed.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.380
I'm furious.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.980
If someone investigates
and follows the trail,

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.260
listen,

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.460
we'll all be exposed!

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.980
As in "diligence".
[*The character "Qin" means diligence.]

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:21.820
We'll be in touch.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.820
Nice save there, hero.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.340
You got wounded.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.420
If you're going to sell it,
make it look real.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.740
Put some real feelings into it.

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.060
Your approach is outdated.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:38.420
You're the expert.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.980
Song Zhizhi is actually quite brave.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.380
Risked everything to save her brother,

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.500
then came back for me.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.580
Quite the heroine.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:48.420
But what happened tonight

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.420
wasn't simple.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.380
Look into it.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.380
Alright.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.300
Nie Xiaofei, tell me,

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.380
what is our purpose in the Song family?

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.500
Have you forgotten?

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.780
Our goal

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.060
is to ensure Song Zhiyan
never inherits anything.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.220
To take the Song family's fortune.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.260
Not to fight over some man

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:13.220
with her!

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.140
Song Zhizhi,

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:22.940
just you wait.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.580
I'll ruin you sooner or later.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.460
He's fine now. He can be discharged.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.300
Thank you.

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.100
Thanks, Zhizhi.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.300
How are you feeling?

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.500
Any discomfort?

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.500
It's nothing. Just minor injuries.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:43.260
Don't worry.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.620
How can I not worry?

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.100
Right after Dad announced you
as the successor,

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.180
this happened.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.180
Zhizhi,

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.220
you seem

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.500
different lately.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.460
You never used
to overthink things like this.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.940
Maybe I didn't care enough
about you before.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.100
Zhiyan,

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.060
you and Dad mean everything to me.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.260
Nothing can happen to either of you.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:06.140
You have to stay safe.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.940
Okay, I understand.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.380
Let's go home. Come on.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.980
Alright, out with it.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.980
Why did you come back so suddenly?

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:19.980
I...

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.100
I want to switch
to studying photography.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:24.820
Xiaofei said

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.340
Yi Wenhan proposed to you.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.340
She told me to come back and celebrate.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:29.940
I thought with the engagement,

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.340
Dad would be happy,

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.620
and he might say yes to me.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.660
So it really was Nie Xiaofei.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.620
I didn't say yes to Yi Wenhan.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.700
She lied to you.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.540
Why would Xiaofei lie to me?

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.060
Was she

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.500
really involved in this?

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.700
Mom.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.100
Grandma! What are you doing here?

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.660
Zhiyan.

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.060
Zhiyan.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.660
Oh, my boy.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:12.020
Such a terrible thing happened to you.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.340
Of course I had to come.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.060
Here, have a seat.

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.660
Let me get a good look at you.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.220
How are you feeling?

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.500
I'm fine, Grandma.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.580
The doctor said

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.100
it's just scratches.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:23.940
I'll be better in a couple of days.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.460
You still need to pay attention.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.180
I'll get you a great doctor

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.780
for a thorough check-up.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.380
Yes, absolutely.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.860
Aunt Wenzhi,

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.620
Zhiyan came back.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.060
You must be surprised.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:46.980
Yes.

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.740
I really was surprised.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.220
My son came back so suddenly.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.060
I was both happy and surprised.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.180
Grandma.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.580
You have no idea
how dangerous it was yesterday.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:02.540
I heard from the police

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.380
that those kidnappers

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.100
beat Zhiyan for money.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.580
What?

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.300
Who would dare

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.700
hurt the only son of the Song family?

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.260
Who knows?

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.940
But it seems like

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.180
someone set this up.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.140
I only found out

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.020
Zhiyan was back after he landed.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.620
Who else could have known

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:31.980
so early?

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.420
I wanted

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.700
to surprise Zhizhi and you.

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.420
So I only told Xiaofei

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.220
about coming back.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:44.620
Xiaofei?

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:45.780
Grandma,

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.860
I... I did know Zhiyan was coming back.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:50.340
But I didn't tell anyone about that.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:51.940
Xiaofei,

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.220
if you knew his flight details,

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.140
why didn't you send the driver
to pick him up?

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.180
You left a car at the airport

00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.740
for him to drive himself back.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.780
What were you thinking?

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.900
I thought the driver was off yesterday?

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.460
Nonsense!

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.300
Wasn't it you who sent the driver away?

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:13.580
What were you trying to do?
What's your game?

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:14.100
Grandma,

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.860
I had a business dinner yesterday
and had some drinks.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.340
I had no choice but to send the driver.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:18.620
I thought

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.420
since Zhiyan was coming back so late,

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.500
if his flight was delayed,

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.900
driving himself might be better.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:26.340
So I left the car there.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.020
He could have taken a regular route.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.260
But he ended up on the most remote one.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.420
I had no idea he'd change routes!

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.420
I did that because of the traffic.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:41.860
See, Grandma?

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:43.820
I really wasn't lying.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.420
Xiaofei, you've always been

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.420
so careless.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.420
You borrowed the car for fun

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.820
and caused this misunderstanding!

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.020
All you care about is having fun!

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.500
You never use your brain!

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.140
Exactly.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:00.260
What's your brain for?

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.820
Apologize to Grandma now.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.020
Grandma.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.860
This is all my fault.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.460
Please don't be upset over this.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.020
I should have thought it through.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:14.300
You meant well,

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.380
but you can't just take matters
into your own hands.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.860
Thankfully, Zhiyan is safe.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.620
What if something had happened to him?

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.900
Could you take that responsibility?

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.220
Xiaofei, from now on,

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.660
you discuss everything

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.380
with Grandma before making a move.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.900
If there's a next time,

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.580
you'll regret it!

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.980
It's all my fault, Grandma.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.620
Please don't be angry.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.060
Don't be mad, please?

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.420
Alright, stop crying.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.660
Look.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.060
Zhiyan went through so much

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.420
and isn't complaining.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.740
I just said a few words,

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.140
and you're already in tears.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.500
People will think

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.860
I'm giving you a hard time.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.820
Grandma, please don't be mad.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:55.460
Grandma.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.180
This is not entirely

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:58.940
Xiaofei's fault.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.260
Blame those bad guys.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.740
But they've already been caught.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.180
The police will get to the truth.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.660
Besides those bad guys,

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.740
I won't let go

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.300
of the people behind them either.
