she probably wants to get close to you.

She probably does.

is suspicious.

Hello, everyone.

for forcibly keeping you here.

with you for him.

the slightest bit of morality?

No, Zhizhi,

Of course it is.

that you loved me wholeheartedly.

the Song family's reputation

to break off the engagement
with the Ji family.

I knew all along that the necklace
you gave me was fake.

But I still treasured it.

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.900
Because I knew you didn't have money.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.420
As long as it was from you,

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.260
I didn't mind.
