00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.920
Though my family
holds the majority stake

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.440

are always sticking their noses
into our affairs.

to win this competition.

is a shoo-in for the championship.

He's already the design director
at our company.

Winning this will get him
a much higher position.

What's there to be so proud of?

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.020
It's all because of his connections
to the Songs.

How about this?

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.740
You go ask the organizers

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:13.460
to reschedule for later.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.700
Song Zhizhi is
from Starlight Group, after all.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:16.820
No.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.340
She's using a pseudonym

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:19.980
instead of her real name

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:20.900
to avoid gossip.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:23.580
I'll check the underground garage.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.780
You keep looking around nearby.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.420
Song Zhizhi!

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:46.700
Song Zhizhi.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.660
Song Zhizhi.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:02.620
Song Zhizhi.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.140
What are you doing? Open the door.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.500
Song Zhizhi.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:33.500
Song Zhizhi.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.300
Song Zhizhi!

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.580
I will work with Zhizhi
to take Starlight Jewelry

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.540
to new heights!

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.500
Winning this award

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.260
is all thanks to my own efforts.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.140
Are you okay?

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.100
Is the competition over?

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.380
Did Yi Wenhan win?

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:55.100
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:56.860
There's still time.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.700
Isn't that Ms. Song?

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.620
She's only showing up now?

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.940
Zhizhi, what are you doing here?

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.100
I'm Enna.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.780
I'm here to compete.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.420
But there are

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.220
less than 30 minutes left.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.460
You can't possibly finish in time.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.300
Who says I can't?

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.380
You're late.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.700
You're disqualified.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.700
Exactly.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.780
Just because your family
holds the competition?

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.520
[Time remaining: 29:54]

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:57.980
According to the rules,

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.420
as long as the contestant arrives
and completes their work

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.220
within the allotted time,

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.140
their entry remains valid.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.780
Miss, let her begin.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.820
Three, two, one.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.060
Time's up.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.300
The competition is over.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.860
Thank you, everyone.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.140
Once the hostesses

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.620
have collected all the entries,

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.820
the works of all the contestants

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.460
will be displayed

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.900
on the screen.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:40.340
What we're seeing now

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.260
are all 25 pieces of work

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.460
from every contestant.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.780
We'll have the judges give their scores

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.540
and cast their votes.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.100
So, who will the judges

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.740
cast their votes for?

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.180
We're all eager to find out.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:12.540
Alright.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.240
[Contestant: Enna, Votes: 562]
[Contestant: Yi Wenhan, Votes: 562]

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.220
The results are in.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.380
Two designers

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.140
have received the same number of votes.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.740
They are Enna

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.340
and Yi Wenhan!

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:23.140
Give it up for them!

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.620
Congratulations to you both.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.380
Now,

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.860
we'll turn it over to our judges

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:33.220
to determine the winner.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.100
How is a tie even possible?

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.820
You're clearly with Starlight Jewelry.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.300
Did you

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.780
rig the theme in advance?

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.900
I'll expose you!

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.380
Stop making such accusations!

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.540
Anyone with half a brain can see

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.980
Ms. Song's design is on another level

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.540
compared to Yi Wenhan's!

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.780
It even rivals Anne's.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.500
Fine, Song Zhizhi.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.860
Since I can't win...

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.500
No need to vote!

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:01.580
Zhizhi,

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.820
since you want this championship
this badly,

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.260
I'll let you have it.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.340
After all, I know

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.620
how rigged these competitions can be.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.260
I don't care about winning.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.300
All I care about is you.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:21.660
You're letting me have it?

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.660
Rigged?

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.220
Have you forgotten?

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.260
You plagiarized my work
in the preliminary round!

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.140
Without me,

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.460
you wouldn't even have qualified
for the competition.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.820
Everyone, look at the screen.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:38.460
On the left

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.580
is my work from high school.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.420
On the right

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.140
is Mr. Yi Wenhan's entry
from the preliminary round.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.380
The resemblance is obvious, isn't it?

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:58.100
This has to be rigged.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.420
Zhizhi.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.340
Stop making a scene.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.660
And there's another thing.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.780
All of Mr. Yi Wenhan's previous works

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.180
were actually ghost designed by others.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.820
I've been in a deal with Mr. Yi Wenhan

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.900
for five years.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.260
Back then, my mother was seriously ill

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:21.380
and I needed money.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.100
These are all my designs.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:26.980
Here's my

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.100
copyright registration certificate.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.140
And these

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.420
are the copyright transfer agreements

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.420
from when Yi Wenhan bought my works.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.780
He published them

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.540
as his own.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.260
You're framing me!

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.020
You're making things up!

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.140
You copied the works
and hired the ghost designer.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.780
What does any of that
have to do with me?

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:55.700
Yi Wenhan,

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.460
we've treated you well.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.260
How could you be so morally bankrupt?

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.620
From now on,

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.260
Yi Wenhan is disqualified
from the competition

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:08.060
and suspended from all duties
at the company!

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.620
He'll wait for further investigation!

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.940
Song Zhizhi...

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.180
Let go of me. Let go!

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.100
Song Zhizhi set me up.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.700
Yeah, I saw everything.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:19.460
I'm hanging up.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:28.940
Hello?

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.100
I thought you had
arranged for Wenhan to win?

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.500
But we didn't expect Song Zhizhi

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.300
to join the competition or get hold

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.260
of the evidence that Wenhan plagiarized.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.260
You said she wasn't that clever.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.900
That was before.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.380
After Xiaofei's birthday,

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.140
I felt she'd changed somehow.

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.420
Do you need me to do anything?

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.460
Look into it thoroughly.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:55.940
I've been taking care
of my little flower for years,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.780
and now it suddenly wants
to bloom and grow its own way?

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.500
I won't allow it.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:09.620
Song Zhizhi.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.220
Since you refuse to behave,

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.380
don't blame me for what happens next.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:27.740
Mom.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:29.740
Mom, look, it's Song Zhizhi.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.700
She's really with Baijian?

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:33.980
Be quiet.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.780
Read the room.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:38.340
Get a grip.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.860
I'm going over.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:52.900
Aunt Wenzhi.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.100
Xiaofei.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.420
Zhizhi,

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.860
why did you come with Baijian?

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.900
I wanted to surprise everyone.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.580
I never realized

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.580
how exceptional Baijian is.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.620
So,

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.420
do you like this surprise?

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:10.740
Love it.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.820
You're adorable.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.660
You taught me well.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.700
Yi Wenhan

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.420
is such a scumbag.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.020
Can't believe I actually loved him.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.300
What kind of mother

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.740
raises a son like that?

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.060
Well, Aunt Wenzhi, Xiaofei,

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.940
you two carry on. I'm going back over.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:31.900
Okay.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.220
Look at her.
What's there to be so proud of?

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.820
You couldn't pull it off.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.900
Don't blame others for being stronger.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.820
Men don't like whiners.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:53.340
Good evening,

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.700
everyone.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.060
First, on behalf of Starlight Jewelry
and Jihong Group,

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.900
I'd like to thank all of you

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.220
for joining us at this gathering!

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.420
Besides,

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.740
the champion of the competition

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.420
is my eldest daughter, Song Zhizhi!

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.180
I hereby announce

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.100
that Zhizhi

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.140
will be joining the design department
of Starlight Jewelry!

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.180
I hope she'll have your support.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.820
Song Zhizhi's win was rigged!

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:29.580
Let go!

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.540
It was rigged!

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.220
Let go of me! Let go!

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.300
It was rigged!

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.300
Yi Wenhan!

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.380
This is not the place for your nonsense!

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.180
Take him away!

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.020
Dad,

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.660
if you do that,
everyone will just think I'm guilty.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.460
I have nothing to hide.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:53.900
Yi Wenhan,

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:55.780
let's hear

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.220
what you have to say.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.740
Everyone!

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.660
I have something shocking

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.900
to share with everyone.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.060
The one who accused me, Song Zhizhi,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.420
is the real plagiarist.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.180
On the left

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.420
is Song Zhizhi's entry
for this competition.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:17.860
On the right

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.700
is a sketch titled "First Love"

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.340
posted by international
jewelry design rising star Anne

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.420
on her personal page.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.340
The two are 70 percent identical!

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.140
Mr. Yi.

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.380
You've got quite the eye.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.100
You accuse me of plagiarism
based on one piece?

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:45.900
Then let me ask you,

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:47.900
as a plagiarist yourself,

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.540
what right or credibility

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.780
do you have to question me?

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.900
I knew

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.660
someone as dishonest as Song Zhizhi

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.380
would deny it

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.300
and even try to pin it on me.

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.980
That's why

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.380
I brought
Anne's original hand-drawn sketches.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.340
Compare them,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.580
and you'll know

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.780
everything I've said is true.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.100
Here.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.580
You even forged something like this?

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.300
Why are these sketches real?

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.320
[Pendant]

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.620
How did you get these sketches?

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.260
Anne gave them to me herself, of course.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.300
Impossible!

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.860
Because I am Anne.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.060
You're Anne?

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.300
I was going to spare you some dignity.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.820
But since you have no shame,

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.500
I won't hold back.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.380
I've got

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.660
a surprise for you.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:19.980
Let's welcome Anne!
