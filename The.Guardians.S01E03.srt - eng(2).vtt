We've checked it out before.

This is our rehearsal hall.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.660
To be honest,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.900
this rehearsal hall of ours

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.820
is bigger than most small theaters.

There's even a show tonight.

No matter how much
you're willing to pay,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.500
I can't just break the contract.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.260

Do you have the final say here?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.260
Of course I do.

This place of mine

It's now rented to the Maxin Troupe.

They're a decent-sized troupe
with 50 to 60 people,

If he is caught by the Japanese...

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.130
Don't come over.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.370
Stay back.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:40.650
Turn around.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.650
I'm untying the rope.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.370
Chaosheng Troupe is right across.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.610
Can't see a thing here.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:50.850
This Gu Yangshan

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.820
is the son of Gu Zhengze,

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.580
the deputy commander
of Chongqing Garrison Command.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.370
He just returned from abroad,

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.610
and is now working for
Shanghai BIS.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.610
He kidnapped Ding Yi

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.010
probably to make him

and find a breakthrough

in decrypting that mysterious code
the Japanese are using

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.730
in the Northern Jiangsu battlefield.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.130
But for Ding Yi,

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.610
this operation is way too dangerous.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.220
I'm sure you know

what I'm getting at.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.180
I'll give you one last chance

Five.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.890
Ding Yi's just an actor.

into something this dangerous.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.980
Gu Yangshan is being too whimsical.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.460
I have a plan.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.100
I'll go find Director William.

What do you think?

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.980
Alright then,

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.980
I'll double it for you.

You did excellent work
when I put you in charge

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.650
of British intelligence.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.850
Director William is about to step down.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.100
So I'd say

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.100
your work has been
successfully completed.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.420
I promised you

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.180
that once the work here is done,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.300
I'd send you to Yan'an.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.940
Since this code is so important,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.610
I'll stay

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.940
to support Ding Yi.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:51.770
In that case,

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.010
I need to report this

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.490
unexpected situation
to the organization first.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:57.370
Be a little patient.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.130
Wait for my word.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.010
I really don't trust the
BIS's methods.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.650
People in northern Jiangsu
and Ding Yi deserve to live.

No.

I won't do it even for ten.

The more money you offer,
the faster I'll die.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:18.250

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.850
and is figuring that if the stand-in
gets exposed and captured,

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.100
he won't get a chance
to reveal our stronghold.

Who said you have to die?

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.300
Besides, ten gold bars

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.650
is an exorbitant price
many wouldn't even dare to dream of.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.490
What's the use of just
being rigorous with details?

Even if Chairman Chiang came,

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.610

do his anti-traitor work?

Do you really think

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.420
you can return to the stage,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.700
living freely like before?

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:14.130
I hear you're from the Northeast.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.530
You came to Shanghai
after the September 18th Incident.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.770
Yeah.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.500
So what?

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.660
My mother risked her life

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.660
to escape with me.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:32.940
So,

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:34.940
if I lose my life here with you,

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.370
how could I face her?

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.700
After the September 18th Incident,

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.660
you escaped from the Northeast
to Shanghai.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.900
But now, the Northeast
and North China have fallen,

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:47.900
Central China is in bitter war,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.940
Shanghai has become a quagmire,

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.660
and the Concessions
are isolated islands.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.940
Sooner or later,

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.090
the Japanese will march
into the Concession.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.330
Where will you run then?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.700
Stop right there.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.130
Don't talk to me about this.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.940
Do you really think we common folks,

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.090
who barely went to school,

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.130
understand nothing?

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:07.610
Why did we run after
the September 18th Incident?

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.940
Because those officers
of the Northeastern Army

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.260
gave up resistance,

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.260
throwing us civilians
into the line of fire.

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.180
I'm telling you,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.180
if not for sheer luck,

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.660
we wouldn't be alive now.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.940
Isn't it the same now?

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.260
The Japanese come,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.740
guns firing.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.700
But where's Chairman Chiang?

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.610
Where is he?

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:31.090
Gone, disappeared.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.130
He hid himself in Chongqing.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.370
What now?

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:34.850
You want us common folks

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.090
to take the bullets for him again?

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.420
I'm telling you, I've figured it out.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:39.530
The higher the official,

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.660
the faster they run.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.570
You're not wrong.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.130
But if everyone thinks this way,

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.130
then our country and homes

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.330
will be destroyed before long.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.180
Don't try labels on me.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.700
We are civilians.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.420
What does war have to do with us?

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.130
Back when the Eight-Nation Alliance
invaded Beijing,

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.130
18,000 troops

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.900
easily captured Beijing,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.130
which had over a hundred
thousand defenders.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.260
Besides the authorities'

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.290
inaction and incompetence,

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.530
there were those who led the enemy in,

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.900
opening the gates for them.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.420
Now the Japanese invaded Nanjing,

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.180
slaughtering 300,000 of our compatriots!

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.900
They're at our doorstep.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.940
And you want to be the one

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.500
to lead them through the gate?

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.500
When did I lead anyone?

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.500
When did I open the gate?

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.020
Don't slander me!

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.700
By teaching the Japanese as Joseph Lee,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.940
you've opened the gates for them.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.180
You've turned your blade
against your own people.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.180
How can you say you haven't?

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.940
I haven't!

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.420
I'm just a commoner.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.180
I'm just an actor.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.940
A mere walk-on!

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.420
What's wrong with me making some money?

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.420
I want to eat, I need to survive!

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.420
Is that wrong?

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.740
My mother is still back home,

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.700
waiting for me to return to Baimahu
and care for her!

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.700
But the Chinese civilians
on the Northern Jiangsu battlefield

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.570
are bleeding and dying
because of the code

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:27.570
you taught them for Joseph Lee.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.940
And you feel nothing?

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.980
You're noble, you're so capable!

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.940
With your privileged background,
you never worry about food or clothing.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.420
Of course you can feel sad
for the country and the people.

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.940
But us? Can we?

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.420
If you were like us,

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.940
digging in the dirt every day,

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.180
and rolling in the mud,

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.940
you are barely able to survive!

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.610
Then you wouldn't think this way!

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.180
Ding Yi, you're right.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.700
I am exactly what you said,

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:11.330
living in luxury

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.420
without worries.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.130
My father

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.850
is the deputy commander
of Chongqing Garrison Command.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.330
He is someone who can sit

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.130
with Chairman Chiang,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.050
drinking tea and watching plays.

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:29.420
I don't want to hear it!

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.180
I didn't hear anything.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.180
I don't want to be silenced.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.660
What I want to say is

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.370
we truly can't

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.660
choose our own birth.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.460
But we can decide

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.460
what kind of things we want to do.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.420
In our family, there's a motto.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.740
Since I was young,

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.700
my father has been teaching me it.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.700
Want to know what it is?

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.090
Serve the country with utmost loyalty?

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.740
Take the lead in battle.

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:30.900
So Ding Yi,

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.370
no matter what trouble

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.810
or danger you face in the future,

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.180
I will always

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.740
stand in front of you.

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.180
Take a look at this,

00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:59.740
and then decide.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.980
Who doesn't have a family motto?

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.090
I have a family motto too.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:42.460
Of the 36 Stratagems,

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.570
running is the best.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.180
Excuse me.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.330
You're here.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.700
I found it.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.940
Joseph Lee's assistant,

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.700
Charlie Gu,

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.180
holds a British passport.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.420
He entered four days ago.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.090
This is his entry record.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.180
Is it genuine?

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.420
Not falsified?

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.180
Unless Joseph Lee's influence

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.610
is powerful enough to control
border and customs officers,

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.940
it can't be falsified.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.180
The military police

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.940
still haven't found
Joseph Lee's whereabouts?

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.180
No.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.940
We found his car parked
at William's Residence

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.180
of the Municipal Council.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.420
We can't search British territory,

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.940
so we sent people

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.940
to watch it around the clock.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.050
No sign of Joseph Lee going in or out.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.180
We've watched him nearly two months.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.420
Apart from work,

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.610
he never leaves his room.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.180
So why suddenly go to

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.610
William's Residence?

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.180
Won't let me leave?

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.940
Fine.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.610
I'll just going to deal with it.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.940
See who can outlast the other.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.180
I'll drink your liquor up first.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.610
Mr. Takeda.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.130
I think Mr. Joseph Lee's been acting

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:27.370
very strangely lately.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.900
Especially

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.610
these past two days,

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.370
he disappeared for so long.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.900
The military police

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.940
haven't been able to track him at all.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.940
In this time,

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.330
no one can guarantee

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.180
there hasn't been any

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.610

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.690
We can't let the Japanese through!

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.090
Gu Yangshan, open the gate!

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:16.690
Gu Yangshan!

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.300
Gu Yangshan, I beg you!

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.610
Open the gate,
I need to go back to Baimahu!

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.170
I'm begging you, Gu Yangshan!

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.170
Open it!

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:28.690
What's wrong?

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.170
Gu Yangshan!

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.170
Tell me,

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.570
what's the situation at Baimahu now?

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:33.780
How is it now?

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.170
Given the current circumstances,

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.170
Baimahu won't last 72 hours.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:51.780
Then what should we do?

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:54.170
Right.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.530
Isn't your father some commander?

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.780
Get him to dispatch troops
to protect Baimahu,

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.170
and my mother!

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:07.250
Forget it.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.250
I knew I couldn't count on you.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.570
I'll go back myself to save my mother.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.170
Don't stop me!

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.170
I want to save Baimahu

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.570
and your mother too,

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:16.780
but what can I do?

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.570
The Japanese army
is at Baimahu right now.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.170
We have no idea

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:20.570
about their operational plans.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:23.090
Even if reinforcements go,
it's just sending them to die.

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.690
If you go back alone, what can you do?

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.690
You can't even get inside on your own!

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.690
Then what?

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:35.460
I can't just leave my mother to die!

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.570
That's why the priority now

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.300
is to replace the enemy's
operational code.

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:43.690
Only then can we

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.170
learn their battle plan

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.570
and turn things around.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.940
Then

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.170
you'd be able to save your mother.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.420
But unfortunately,

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.050
we only have three days.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:57.170
Just three days.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.690
That's why you came looking for me.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:16.340
Young Master.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:19.090
You haven't eaten all day.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.570
This is your favorite noodles.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:23.300
You made it?

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.130
Ding Yi.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:34.690
If you insist on leaving,

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.690
I won't stop you.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.530
But before you go,

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:39.170
eat this bowl of noodles.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.530
Don't go hungry on the road.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.050
Try it.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.690
Uncle Gu's noodles

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:46.050
are different from others'.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.120
Here.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.650
I, Joseph Lee,

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.380
never eat this kind of thing.

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:13.860
Joseph Lee is skilled at Go.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.860
Takeda is also a Go master.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.050
Before I substituted for Joseph Lee

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.530
to meet Takeda for the first time,

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.340
Joseph Lee had taught me

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.690
Go for nearly a month.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.610
With my previous experience
gambling on Go,

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:26.570
I barely managed a draw with Takeda.

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:29.300
White, 80.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.090
Tengen.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.570
White, two-three, push through.

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.690
One-three, cut.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.690
White, capture one.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:46.690
One-three, throw in again.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.730
You're about to use the play
"under the stones".

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.170
Actually,

00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.690
if it really were Takeda,

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.570
he would've seen my intent

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.130
from the very start of my layout.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.020
Yangshan,

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.250
you've found yourself a good helper.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.530
Alright, you two carry on.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.250
I have another meeting, I'll go first.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.530
You chat.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.730
Goodbye, sir.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.380
Morse code,

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:21.780
also called Morse telegraph code.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:23.650
Excuse me.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.170
Joseph Lee had taught me
all this before.

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:28.210
Why don't we

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:30.090
go straight to the hard stuff?

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:32.780
Alright.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.130
Let's get to the point,

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.860
and talk about transmission methods.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.900
The organization believes

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:41.420
cracking Joseph Lee's code

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.300
is beneficial to the overall war effort.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.380
Therefore,

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.300
you are authorized to provide support

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.570
to assist Ding Yi's operation

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.090
and protect his safety.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:51.940
However,

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:54.500
do not blow your cover.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.420
Understood.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:02.650
[Heading 30 km north tonight]
If I want to send this order

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.250
to troops a hundred miles away,

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.340
our encryption method

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.530
would still use
the traditional codebook.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:10.530
The cipher officer
would look up the codebook

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.820
and convert every Chinese character
in this order

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.860
into groups of four Arabic numerals.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.690
[Cipher Officer]

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.780
Then the telegrapher
would use Morse code

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.570
to send the encrypted order

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.900
[Telegrapher]
over the radio

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.020
to the receiving operator
a hundred miles away.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.900
[Receiver]
The receiver would write it down

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.250
then hand the recorded

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.020
eight groups of encrypted numbers

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.130
to the decryptor.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.420
The decryptor would check the codebook,

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:38.420
[Decryptor]
decrypt the numbers

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:39.650
and translate them back
into Chinese characters.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.780
Finally, deliver the order

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.610
to their commander.

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.570
So, by your logic,

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.300
can't we just steal the codebook

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.900
directly?

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.820
I'd love to steal

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.570
the enemy's codebook.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:00.460
But you don't understand

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.050
that this codebook

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:03.650
is intel more valuable than life.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.340
So it's not something we can just get

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.020
whenever we want.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.900
But the encryption methods
are comparable.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.420
So without the codebook,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.900
we can find patterns

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.300
and crack the code

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.250
by comparing ciphertexts

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.300
with existing intel.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.420
Then...

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.420
As long as we gather

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.900
enough samples for comparison,

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.780
there's hope to crack it.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.500
Exactly.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.900
So in this world,

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.420
there's no absolutely secure codebook

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.900
unless...

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.340
Unless

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.020
the set of numbers
corresponding to a message

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:38.210
is not fixed.

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.650
You're much smarter than I thought.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.570
Kondo,

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.420
you're our best codebreaker

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.420
at the MSS.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.820
From a professional perspective,

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:55.860
you also think

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.050
he's suspicious?

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.130
In these past two months,

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.860
I've attended Mr. Lee's lectures
every week.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.820
I noticed that every time,

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.420
he never does calculations on site.

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.340
He just uses his eye condition
as an excuse

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.900
to take it back to the hotel to work on.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:16.900
But why

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.570
are the coefficients
of the key derivation function

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:23.020
always the same numbers?

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.340
You're asking too many questions.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.130
So you mean,

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.570
you suspect

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:46.530
the eye condition is just his excuse.

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.380
Yes.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.570
I suspect the eye condition
might be his cover.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.090
There must be some secret

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.460
unknown to others

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.090
