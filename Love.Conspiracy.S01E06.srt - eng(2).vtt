00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.300
hadn't invited me
to the competition today,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.660
I wouldn't have known someone

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.020
Just who are you?

She never wanted to be in the spotlight.

But she never expected

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.580

to get this out of hand.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.260

I can confirm

that Ms. Song Zhizhi here

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.980
is the real Anne.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.340
How is that possible?

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.100
Over the years,
we've only kept in touch online

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.700
and never actually met in person.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.740
A few days ago,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.940
Yi Wenhan privately messaged

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.900
Anne's account,

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.100
claiming someone was impersonating her.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.020
To protect Anne's reputation,

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.940
I had to expose the fraud.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.740
But I never expected

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.260
Ms. Song wasn't an imposter.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.220
She is the real Anne!

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.420
Anne.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.100
Earlier, at the entrance,

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.340
Yi Wenhan told me

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.580
to introduce myself as Anne

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.140
to make the exposure more convincing.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.220
He also gave me a card

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.940
with one million on it.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:26.580
Sorry.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.260
I shouldn't have agreed.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.020
You decide what to do
with the money now.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.420
Since you're being so generous,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.660
I'll accept it.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.780
I'll donate this one million

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.100
to the International Jewelry Foundation

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.180
to set up a dedicated fund

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.420

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.500
Song Zhizhi, you...

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.340
Thanks.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.300
But exposing them in public

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.100
was so satisfying.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.340
So good.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.460
Nice acting.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.020
For this competition,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.340
I'll imitate Anne's style.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.300
That snake Yi Wenhan

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.740
would definitely suspect me.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.220
I even let him steal my design drafts.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.020
Knowing him,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.700
he'd make a huge deal out of it.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.820
Nice move.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.420
Playing with fire.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.900
It's not playing with fire.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.620
It's flushing out the rat.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.980
Song Zhizhi.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.700
Song Zhizhi.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.860
Wenhan,

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.220
you worked so hard

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.900
all these years

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.500
to build your reputation
in the design world.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.660
And just like that,

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.060
she ruined everything.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:54.060
I mean,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.100
who would've known
she is the real Anne?

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.500
I ended up embarrassing myself today!

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.860
But why?

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.940
There are so many men out there.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.980
Why does she have to
steal Baijian from me?

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.540
She just can't stand seeing me happy.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.820
But why?

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.980
But why does she get to

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.980
destroy your career

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.820
and my love life so easily?

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.820
Wenhan,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.420
even if you can take this,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.620
I can't!

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.300
What else can we do?

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.620
Mom told us

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.500
not to make any moves lately.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.780
But Mom also said she had looked
into what happened today!

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.380
Look how things turned out.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.420
You were embarrassed like this.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.540
Maybe Mom

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.460
isn't always right.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.420
By the way,

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.020
the results are out
for the milk sample you gave me.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.780
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.620
The milk is fine?

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.580
How could that be?

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.700
My dad's medical report shows

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.860
a chronic stimulant in his blood.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.500
Long-term use

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.180
can have serious side effects.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.220
It could even put someone
in a vegetative state.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.380
I thought it was because of the milk.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:23.700
But how could this happen?

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.860
The results for the hair sample
you asked me to test

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.740
are also out.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.220
The results show

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.460
Nie Xiaofei is not related to Yi Wenhan

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.500
or Nie Wenzhi.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.780
But Yi Wenhan and Nie Wenzhi
are biologically related.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.420
They're mother and son?

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.100
So what are you suspecting?

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.220
Wenhan.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.100
Just thinking about how Song Zhizhi

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:57.860
used to be

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.700
completely under your control

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.060
makes me feel better.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.180
Do you want things to get back on track?

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.860
I have a way

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.540
to make her

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.980
truly yours.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.860
Mine?

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.660
I suspect those three
are plotting against my family

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.060
and have been drugging my father's milk.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.700
I wanted to show him

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.300
the test report as proof.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.380
But things didn't turn out as I thought.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.820
It's true that you can't see clearly
when you're involved.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.140
What good would exposing them do?

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.100
Do you want everyone to know

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.100
Nie Wenzhi and Yi Wenhan
are mother and son

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.180
so they can reunite?

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.860
Or prove Nie Wenzhi

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.460
adopted Nie Xiaofei

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.020
to show how kind she is?

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.420
How does that help you?

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.820
You can't trust anyone easily.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.660
Usually, the ones you trust the most

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.980
are the ones who hurt you the deepest.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.500
Ji Baijian,

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.260
good thing we're allies,

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:32.660
not enemies.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.980
What's most important now is

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.860
shaking my dad's trust in Nie Wenzhi.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.420
Only then will this test report
mean something.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.980
Otherwise, it's just a piece of paper.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.260
But Nie Wenzhi
has been setting this up for years.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.380
Her defenses are rock-solid.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.140
Breaking through

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.460
won't happen overnight.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.700
But if

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.020
I erode her trust bit by bit?

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.140
When the time comes,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.740
her foundation
will collapse in an instant.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.260
Come out. Let's meet.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.140
I told you

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.580
to verify every detail
about Song Zhizhi.

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:24.900
I never expected

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.340
she's actually Anne.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.860
Now she has Ji Baijian by her side.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.300
That'd cause big problems for our plans.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:37.700
Understood.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.140
Wenzhi,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.820
let's go talk to Ji.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.340
Okay.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.540
I can't believe you're really Anne.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.700
Exactly.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.140
Yi Wenhan is such a scumbag.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.420
That's why girls really have to
keep their eyes open.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.060
Cheers.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.660
- You're amazing.
- So impressive.

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.580
[Xiaofei]
Zhizhi, let's have a heart-to-heart.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.700
Excuse me for a moment.

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.380
Zhizhi.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.020
You're here.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:40.540
Xiaofei,

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.780
what did you want to talk about?

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.100
I was just wondering

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.620
why you suddenly stopped

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:47.540
liking Wenhan.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.780
Weren't you totally into him...

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.020
I was naive back then.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.060
Not anymore.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.780
But he's always been so good to you.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.100
Was he really good to me?

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:57.780
Yeah.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.500
He's always treated you well.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.420
Zhizhi.

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:02.260
Xiaofei.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.380
Wenhan.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.220
You're here.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.620
What are you doing here?

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.260
I came to apologize.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:15.940
Xiaofei,

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.700
we'll talk another time.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:18.980
Zhizhi,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.460
don't be mad.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.740
It was all my fault.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.460
I sincerely apologize.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.940
I won't bother you anymore.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.380
Let's have this drink

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.020
and forget all the unhappiness
from the past.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.300
Alright?

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.700
Yeah, Zhizhi.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.820
Just forgive him.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.140
Take it easy on the drinks.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.220
Cheers.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.220
Cheers.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.020
Forget?

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.820
Yi Wenhan,

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.740
your pathetic acting

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.820
makes me sick.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.100
Zhizhi. Zhizhi.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:38.740
Zhizhi.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.060
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.420
Let me go with you
to the restroom to clean up.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.980
Ji, just as you predicted.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.900
Yi Wenhan and Nie Xiaofei

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.780
were plotting against Song Zhizhi.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.660
I overheard everything
outside the dressing room.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.100
By then,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.580
Baijian won't want her anymore.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.580
You'll

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.700
become the Song family's son-in-law,

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:13.780
and I'll

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.740
become the Ji family's daughter-in-law.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.100
Plotting against Song Zhizhi?

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.540
Yes.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.420
She was just here.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.460
Check the surveillance.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:30.020
Okay.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:45.860
Zhizhi.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.940
I just remembered I forgot my phone.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:48.700
Wait for me.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.100
Zhizhi.

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:00.980
Wenhan.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.300
You're here.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:06.940
Cheers.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.700
Cheers.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.060
Hello?

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.460
Hey, Ji.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.940
I just arrived at the surveillance room.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:44.940
Excuse me, sir.

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.860
I can't find my friend.

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.700
Could you please
check the surveillance footage?

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.420
This one!

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:57.900
Yeah, this one.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.220
Hello?

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.420
Found her.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.820
Yi Wenhan took her away.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.540
It's on the 20th floor.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:08.940
You sure it's this floor?

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.380
I'll send you the room number now.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:11.740
Okay.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:33.700
Everything's ready.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.860
Send those people up to take photos.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.860
Song Zhizhi!

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.100
Zhizhi!

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:15.580
You scum.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.220
I'm here.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.100
Hello?

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:05.860
Ji,

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.020
they're rushing up now.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.700
If they catch you

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.180
holding Song Zhizhi like this
while she's out of it,

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.380
it'll be a huge scandal.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.380
Hide now.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.420
I couldn't stop them.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.580
That's exactly what I wanted.
