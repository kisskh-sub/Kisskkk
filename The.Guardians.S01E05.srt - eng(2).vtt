[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 5]

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.260
Mr. Lee,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.740
I'm very sorry.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.460
Mr. Takeda wants to see you.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.620
Mrs,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.380
I apologize for the trouble.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.180
Mr. Lee, can I help you?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.380
No, ma'am. But I appreciate it.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.450
Charlie.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.380
Yes, sir.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.170
My clothes.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.100
Yes.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.850
Step back!

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.380
Mr. Takeda is waiting for you. Please.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.690
Glad you made it, Mr. Lee.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.410
It's good to see you're safe.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.780
You left Metropolitan Hotel
without notice.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.820
We didn't know
you visited William's Residence.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.540
We worried someone might harm you,

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.260
so we've been looking for you.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.780
Sorry about what happened tonight.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.340
I didn't manage my team well.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.540
My apologies, Mr. Lee.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.820
I'll do anything

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.540
to fix my mistake.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.340
I never speak with disrespectful people.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.250
Just talking gets us nowhere.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.460
What are you doing?

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.730
Are you okay?
You scared me.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.170
Blind eyes can't see,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.140
but their remaining senses:

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.580
Sound, smell, taste, and touch,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.250
become sharper than most.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.340
But for sudden attacks,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.340
there's no way to dodge them.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.140
So just now, your reaction

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.140
gave away your position.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.250
Takeda never acts
like that with Joseph Lee.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.810
He wouldn't dare.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.540
He didn't dare before.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.100
He'll definitely dare now.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.810
What do you mean?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.780
Counting from Joseph Lee's death,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.340
he's been gone from
Takeda's sight for three days.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.780
Takeda will definitely get suspicious.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.780
He'll try all sorts of ways to test you.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.780
Mr. Lee,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.340
I've apologized to you for Kondo.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.580
But you still won't forgive him.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.220
Are you still willing

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.780
to keep working with us?

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.460
Excuse me, sir.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.220
The Japanese kidnapped

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.340
Mr. William's guest.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.220
Could you stop them

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.980
before they leave?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.540
Let me say this again.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.370
I

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.100
never talk to people who disrespect me.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.900
Mr. Takeda,

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.810
if what you're doing

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.340
works on me,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.020
do you think

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.220
I'd still be sitting here?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.930
Guns still have their place.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.580
At least, you're willing to talk now,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.660
right?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.250
If you see the current situation

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.540
as some kind of conversation,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.980
then honestly, we really

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.250
have nothing left to discuss.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.340
Thank you, Mr. Takeda.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.900
I think our cooperation

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.370
really should end here.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.900
I got it.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.340
This is the Public Concession.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.850
Please hand over Mr. William's guests.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.580
Step aside.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.170
Get out of the way!

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.900
Don't worry. Please calm down.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:22.930
We're friends,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.850
okay?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.370
Mr. Lee,

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.540
there's no need to be afraid.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.900
I just had Kondo executed.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.370
This is my way of apologizing.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.900
I hope you'll reconsider

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.370
working with the MSS.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.730
I did it because he failed his job.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.340
He shamed the Empire of Japan

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.610
in front of everyone.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:55.220
He wasn't fit to be
a Japanese soldier anymore.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.100
Mr. Lee,

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.420
I think I've shown my sincerity.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.180
Tomorrow night,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.100
I'll host a dinner
at the Metropolitan Hotel.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.100
I'll give you a formal apology.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.420
Let's start our new partnership.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.730
I'm sure, Mr. Lee,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.100
you won't skip it, right?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.940
Let's go.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.850
Yes.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.180
Tomorrow night,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.180
at the Metropolitan Hotel.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.610
Takeda wants to host a dinner.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.420
Get in the car first.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.300
Biyun?

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.980
What are you looking at?

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.460
You seem lost in thought.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:35.730
A life lost.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.580
I'm not that brave.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.980
Don't scare me, alright?

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.610
Didn't you just say

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.890
you had news for Chairman Wang?

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.580
What is it?

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:13.610
Uncle Gu.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.300
Come on.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.610
Mind your step.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.460
Uncle Gu.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.610
Please help him inside first.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.340
Ms. Xian, is something wrong?

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.340
He almost got shot
by Takeda in the first mission.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.460
So this was your plan all along?

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.700
Ms. Xian, you know exactly

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.060
what happened today was an accident.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.460
It's honestly
a miracle Ding Yi survived.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.460
Thanks for your help, Ms. Xian.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.580
But let's be clear about one thing.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.980
Once we leave the Chaosheng Theatre,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.980
it's just

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.300
between Ding Yi and me.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.850
So

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.180
you're really risking his life on this.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.850
If this is your work plan,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.580
he might as well go home.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.530
Ms. Xian, have you never taken a risk

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.460
in your work before?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:09.820
Ms. Xian,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.580
I can only promise you one thing.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.250
If a gun points at him again,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.770
I'll still step in front of him.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.370
If there's nothing else, Ms. Xian,

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.890
you can leave now.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.730
So you're saying Ding Yi really

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.820
passed out drunk?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.250
Yeah, totally out of it.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:10.580
Got it.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.010
Tomorrow's plan
at Takeda's dinner is off.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.850
I can't agree to that.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:18.850
Me neither.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.100
Ding Yi,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.490
even with his talent,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.180
has never really had

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.340
proper training in math.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.850
He'll slip up

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.700
someday for sure.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:29.740
Besides,

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.530
he's basically just a street guy,

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.530
not cut out to be

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:35.620
an intelligence officer.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.650
Today's events made that clear.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.860
This mission we planned

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.890
turned out to be a complete joke.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.620
I think I explained clearly to you both

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.100
what happened tonight.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:46.890
For today's mission,

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.100
Ding Yi pulled it off perfectly.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.380
He didn't blow his cover at all,

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.530
and even set Takeda up

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.860
to take out a Japanese code-breaker.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.650
Young Master,

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.650
you've had proper intelligence training,

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.890
so you should know

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.770
one key rule in intelligence work

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.980
is never to count on
luck or coincidence.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.460
But let me tell you something too,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.650
what happened today

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.530
once again proves

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.100
he has the ability to adapt on the spot,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.170
which is what it takes to be an agent.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.140
Yangshan.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:13.460
Before this operation began,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.650
what did you promise me?

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.380
Back then, I promised you,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.530
we'd use Takeda's trust in Joseph Lee,

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.340
then tell him the cipher was leaked

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.020
and have it changed.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.340
Tomorrow is the most crucial step.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.620
That's not what I meant.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.380
I meant even if the plan fails,

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.100
we'd only lose one person.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.650
Just a background actor in the troupe.

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.890
There'd be no real loss for us.

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.770
But what about now?

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.530
There'd still be no real loss.

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.890
The plan won't fail, no one will die.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.220
Plus, he doesn't know who you are

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:41.980
nor who I am,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.890
and has no clue where the stronghold is.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:44.650
Even if he's interrogated,

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:45.890
what could he possibly reveal?

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.650
But let me say this,

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.460
you're acting as his assistant,

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.860
working with him side by side.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.770
He's so drunk today,

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.340
what if something goes wrong?

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.100
You could end up dragged in too!

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.770
How could I ever face your father?

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.220
Yangshan,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.340
Commander Gu was my old boss.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.340
He's always looked out for me.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.890
He trusted me to take care of you.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:21.100
If something happened to you,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.620
I'd have no way to face your father.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.650
How about this,

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.380
I'll file a report with Chongqing.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.890
For all the consequences of
these matters and actions,

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.530
I'll take them on alone,

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:32.530
life or death.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.620
If you still don't trust me,

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:36.980
wait till sunrise.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.570
I'll explain to my dad myself, okay?

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.450
No need, you don't have to explain.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.860
You're the only heir of the Gu family.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.450
Just you, the single branch.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.300
Your dad won't let you take that risk.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.650
That's between me and my dad.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:55.890
Please don't worry about it.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.380
Just focus on mending your socks.

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:05.770
Young man, you don't get it.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.900
Big things require breaking rules.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.090
Ding Yi.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:37.940
Ding Yi.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.850
What now?

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.420
You still think I'll run off?

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.020
Sir, two more bowls of noodles.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.220
Got it.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.020
In my whole life,

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:09.940
I've never been that scared before.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.460
I was so scared I nearly wet myself.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.420
About what happened last night,

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.810
I kept thinking about my biggest regret.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.700
I should've just eaten

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.420
that bowl of Yangchun noodles
you gave me.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.460
Even if it was my last meal,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.330
I'd rather go out with a full stomach.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.260
No matter how big the problem is,

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.740
nothing beats having a good meal.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.260
Noodles are here.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.810
Here you go.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.330
Try it.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.900
It's better than that snail you picked.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.050
You know, I've noticed something.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.370
Whenever I'm around you,

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.980
nothing ever goes smoothly.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.500
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.020
It's not like I'm doing this for you.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.740
I'm doing it for my mom.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.260
Yeah, that's right.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.940
As his teacher,

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.500
I really can't handle him.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.220
You're his father.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.940
You should really talk to him.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.940
Yes, yes.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.530
He's here. I'll put him on.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.090
Alright.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.940
Here, your dad wants you.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.090
Dad.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.260
[Gu Zhengze, Deputy Commander of Chongqing Garrison Command]
Yuanzhong told me the plan.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.810
How confident are you in it?

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.570
To be honest,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.940
time's tight, so less than ten percent.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:07.940
Soldiers in battle

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.220
can't rely on luck.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:11.420
But,

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.220
are you always certain to win

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.740
every time you go to the battlefield?

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.980
Honestly, I've thought about this a lot.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.740
This is our only shot

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.740
to cracking Joseph Lee's cipher.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.420
If we win,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.090
we can win battles in Northern Jiangsu.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:27.810
If we lose...

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.980
If things go wrong,

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.570
this might be the last time

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.610
I ever get to call you.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.220
Yuanzhong told me

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:45.980
you got hurt.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.940
Dad,

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.050
just a small injury. How's your stomach?

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:54.420
It's much better now.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.460
You still need to take your medicine.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.330
You always tough it out when you're ill.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.330
Isn't that just not wanting to age?

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.660
Dad,

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.460
I'm sorry I haven't been a good son.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.570
I've been back for a while,

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.530
but I still haven't visited you.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.850
It's hard to balance duty and family.

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:20.770
Since we were kids, you taught us

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.260
to lead by example.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.290
So if I can do something now

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.330
to help battles in Northern Jiangsu

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.500
and to save thousands of lives,

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.260
I think you'll understand my choice.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.940
I do.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:48.850
When the job is done,

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.570
drop by home and see us.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:52.700
I will.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.980
By then, I believe,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.530
more than just me will come home.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.220
Good.

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:16.500
What does Commander Gu say?

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.810
Yangshan, let's hear your plan.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.090
Like I mentioned earlier,

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.810
Japan Air Force Unit 153

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.980
was among the first

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:31.810
using Joseph's cipher.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.220
We can't break their encrypted messages,

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.460
so we have no clue at all

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.020
when their next air raid will be

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.460
or what the target is.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.940
You want Ding Yi to trick Takeda,

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.460
but Ding Yi isn't Joseph Lee.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.940
He doesn't even know the cipher system

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.460
or the basic algorithm.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.940
He doesn't need to know any of that,

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.020
but I do.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.220
Mr. Cao,

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.660
I need your support.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.570
How am I supposed to help?

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.700
Tonight, I'll have Ding Yi talk Takeda

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.810
into using Joseph's cipher to send

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.260
a message to the Japan Air Force.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.420
Saying there's an air raid tonight.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.090
To protect the info, Takeda

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.700
will only mobilize Air Force Unit 153

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.260
he can coordinate.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.220
And the mission of Unit 153

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.500
is bombing Northern Jiangsu.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.940
The one stationed there

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.260
is the Nationalist Army 405th Battalion.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.700
So as long as the 405th Battalion

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.020
triggers the air raid siren

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.940
after the telegram is sent,

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.570
then,

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.180
to the Japanese,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.220
Joseph Lee's cipher
won't be safe anymore.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.300
It's already nine thirty in the morning.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.780
Even if it's just an emergency report,
I still need to convince

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.740
the Commander-in-Chief of
the Lu-Su War Zone.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.780
If we follow the proper process,

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.700
there might be issues...

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.740
Absolutely not.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.090
Mr. Cao, about this operation's details,

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.980
not a word can leak out.

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.570
What did you say?

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:40.850
Eleven Shanghai liaison points
were wiped out.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.540
How did our intel get out?

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.980
None of us knows anything now.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.780
That's why this time,

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.570
we have to keep things quiet inside.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:51.780
It's absurd.

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.980
Mr. Cao,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.500
as far as I know,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.500
the Commander-in-Chief
of Su-Lu-Wan Border,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.850
Li Mingyang,

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.020
is an old friend of yours.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.500
The 405th Battalion reports
directly to him.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.540
So if you're willing,

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.060
no need to report up to Chongqing.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.370
You crafty rascal,

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:19.300
always finding loopholes.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.540
Now you're scheming against me.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.260
Mr. Cao,

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:28.090
for you, it's just a phone call,

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.570
but for the people in Northern Jiangsu,

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.020
it's a matter of life and death.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:41.980
Commissioner Luo.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.060
Do you think he's just messing around?

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:44.850
It's worth a try.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:48.060
It's worth a try.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:48.740
What?

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.130
I agree, no one outside this room

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.260
should know.

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:54.540
Commissioner Luo,

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.780
did you forget what you said before?

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:58.060
I didn't.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.980
Honestly, I still think this is risky.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:02.410
But,

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:04.540
if it works,

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:05.980
it could help us win.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:09.980
I promise to see it through.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.810
I'll back you up, Gu Yangshan,

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:13.940
anything you need.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.890
I just wanted to test your resolve.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.130
Alright, I'm in.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.220
As for Chief Commander Li,

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.020
I'll go talk to him myself.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.300
Well,

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.740
thank you on behalf of all.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.610
Really, thank you, Mr. Cao.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.610
Is this really your place?

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.300
Come on, give me a hand.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.700
Yangshan,

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.850
will you be back when the flowers bloom?

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:49.020
Let's go.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:07.060
Chief Cao,

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.540
it's getting late, time to head out.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.020
No rush, it's still early.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.220
Taizhou's pretty far from here.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.940
Even driving fast,
it'll take half a day.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.090
Chief Cao.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.330
Or did you never plan

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:33.370
on going in the first place?

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:50.740
Ding Yi.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:54.090
What are you doing?

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.500
You just barge in without knocking.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.460
You scared me half to death.

00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:57.810
Time to get up now.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.130
Young Master is waiting downstairs.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:04.570
Alright, just give me five more minutes.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:13.500
No manners, sneaking in while I shower.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:27.250
Yangshan,

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.610
will you be back when the flowers bloom?

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:46.540
Young Master.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:49.940
Ding Yi has memorized your instructions.

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.940
Just waiting for you to check it out.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.250
Thank you, Uncle Gu.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.940
Have you reached out to the Bureau?

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:01.980
I called three times, nobody picked up.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:04.570
Maybe they're still out.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:06.210
No answer at all?

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.770
If Chief Commander Li does me the favor

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.090
and has the air raid siren set off,

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.940
or even retreat,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.380
and the Japanese planes don't show up,

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.250
the higher-ups will blame someone.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.730
Do you think they'll put the blame

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.130
on me or on him?

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.820
If you don't want to go, why agree?

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.650
Him?

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:46.210
He's a spoiled heir from the Gu family.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.690
Really naive.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.860
If I turn him down to his face,

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.460
he'll just run off

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.730
and complain to his dad about me.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.610
Why make trouble for myself?

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.290
If he wants to act, I'll play along.

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:07.690
But if he's heading into danger,

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.820
I won't go that far for him.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.060
After all, I have family to care for.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.060
Come in.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.940
Mr. Cao, the car's ready.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.690
Alright, I'm on my way.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.340
If he asks about it later,

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.290
just say I've delivered the messages

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.020
but the car broke down halfway.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:36.540
Before eight tonight,

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.820
I'll talk Takeda

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.340
into using Joseph Lee's cipher

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.130
to send a message to
the Japan Air Force.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:43.130
Tell them to prep for an air raid.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:44.500
At eight o'clock sharp,

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.980
you'll have the nearest 405th Battalion

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.290
set off the air raid alarm.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:49.290
That'll trick Takeda,

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.020
making him think the cipher is leaked.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.060
If...

00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:59.820
If Takeda asks you,

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.290
how was Joseph Lee's cipher leaked,

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:02.940
what will you say?

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.170
I'll say Director William told me.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.650
All my hard work went to waste.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:09.460
So out of frustration,

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.420
I want to go back to the UK.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.460
Wait,

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.420
what if Takeda checks

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.570
with Director William?

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.540
Wouldn't that give us away?

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:22.820
No, it won't.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.460
Director William isn't well,

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.210
so he resigned from his job.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.290
He's heading back to the UK soon.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.570
That dinner is his farewell party.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:03.460
Hello?

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:05.290
Hello?

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:07.250
Any response yet?

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:12.060
Alright.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.460
Got it.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.650
Did something happen?

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.060
Don't worry.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:28.570
The car broke down. Couldn't reach him.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.210
Really?

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:32.460
Wait,

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:33.820
since they lost touch,

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.570
how did he know the car broke down?

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.500
Gu Yangshan,

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.980
it's just two hours left

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.250
before we head to meet Takeda.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:45.170
What if the air raid siren

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.860
isn't sounded at eight o'clock sharp?

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.460
Are you thinking of calling it off?

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:53.690
Uncle Gu.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:55.900
You and Uncle Gu

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:58.610
go to the restaurant.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:00.460
I'll head to the Bureau first.

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:02.980
Wait, why are you going there?

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.130
Seriously, at this hour?

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.700
Before you even arrive there,

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.610
Takeda and I might finish dinner.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.500
No, no. Relax, I've got it.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.340
I'll make sure the siren goes off.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:14.170
Okay?

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.250
So what's your plan then?

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:16.250
Come on, tell me.

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:19.290
Gu Yangshan.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.940
Are you going to improvise?

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.770
That's not really your style.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.820
I have a plan.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.570
If you do, then tell me.

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.420
Is it that hard to say?

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.020
I'm the one risking my life now.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.420
Even your teacher ran off.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:34.730
If the air raid siren

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.130
doesn't go off,

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:38.290
Takeda will shoot me first.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:39.290
Let me tell you.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.570
I'm not

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:42.570
with the Anti-Traitor Squad.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.420
I work for the BIS.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.130
But because of the rules,

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:47.210
I can't tell you more.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.500
But trust me on this,

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.730
I can handle it.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.940
Just as I thought.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.380
I knew you weren't that simple.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:01.130
But Ding Yi, remember this,

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.610
no matter what happens today,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.060
you won't be in any real danger.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.650
If Takeda swaps out Joseph Lee's cipher,

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.900
then we've pulled it off.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.770
You won't have any trouble.

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.170
If we fail...

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.210
Just a suppose.

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.060
The 405th Battalion
doesn't sound the air raid siren,

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.900
it just means your intel was off.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:18.570
Right?

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:21.340
But Takeda

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.940
still needs Joseph Lee's cipher

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.820
to send out information.

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.250
So they won't lay a finger on you.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:31.610
But that's Takeda.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:33.980
When he snaps, he even turns on his own.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:34.860
You've seen it for yourself.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.980
Well, listen.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.380
No matter what happens,

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.020
I'll always stand in front of you,

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:44.540
shielding you from harm.

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.610
Alright, we'll split up.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.610
You head to the restaurant,
I'll go to the station.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.210
I promise before eight o'clock,

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:55.820
I'll get that air raid siren up.

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:57.380
Splitting up?

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.340
What if something goes wrong?

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.290
How will you cover for me?

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:03.940
I'll get to the Normandy Private Room.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.020
Until then, just keep Takeda busy.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.170
Eat, drink, whatever works.

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:09.290
But don't get to the main topic

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.060
until I show up.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.250
You're seriously out of your mind.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.420
I really am a little crazy.

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.980
But if there are

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.020
more crazy people like me,

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:35.460
the invaders would've been gone already.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.610
Uncle Gu,

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.730
can Gu Yangshan really pull this off?

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.980
If he says so, it'll work.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:03.820
Gu,

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:05.980
you think everything

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:07.610
he does is perfect,, right?

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.340
Why are you so sure he can do anything?

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.290
Wanna meet the lady of our family?

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.210
Maybe that's not a good idea.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:24.060
Listen, Gu,

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.690
you really should work on this habit.

00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:27.210
Why do you never knock before entering?

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.770
It's pretty rude.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.940
What if the lady is showering inside?

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.380
Am I right?

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.460
Wait, this is...

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.130
