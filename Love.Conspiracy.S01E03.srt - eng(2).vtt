if you won't be on our side,

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.060
I can't risk dedicating

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.100
the Ji family's resources

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.620
to help your family.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.940
Unless you become my wife

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.660
and swear

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.860
never to betray me,

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.860
I won't lift a finger.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.220
The commitment

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.140
should go both ways.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.780
I hope you'll be faithful too.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.100
Bye.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.420
Good morning, Ms. Zhu.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.340
Zhiyan, you're up.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.740
Let me take a look at you.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.220
I'm fine, Ms. Zhu.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.780
Thank goodness you're safe.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.020
All thanks to Zhizhi.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.500
But I still need to talk to her.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.900
A young girl

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.020
running off to such a remote place
at midnight?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.140
It's too dangerous.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.940
Just thinking about it terrifies me.

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.380
But

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.300
what was she doing out there?

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.380
She was on her way
to pick up a friend from the airport.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.300
If she hadn't spotted my car by chance,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.100
I might not be here
to enjoy your congee today.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:45.980
Don't say that. It's bad luck.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.340
Eat up.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.020
There are more dishes. I'll go get them.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.300
Thank you, Ms. Zhu.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:11:59.900
Zhizhi,

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.460
Ms. Zhu's asking about last night too.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.980
Dad,

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.420
try this. Zhiyan made it.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.380
Alright.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.500
Thank you.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.860
It's really good.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:16.780
Really?

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:19.100
By the way, Dad,

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.420
I've already had the lawyer
talk to them.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.100
If they reveal who's behind this,

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.180
the lawyer will petition
the legal authorities

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.820
for sentence reductions.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.340
How dare they target my child?

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.180
We must find out

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.260
who's behind this!

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:37.340
Xiaofei,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.380
what's wrong?

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.180
You look pale.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.940
Is the soup not to your liking?

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.660
It's nothing. I... I just slipped.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.180
Honey,

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.380
Zhiyan's cooking is impressive.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.860
He's full of surprises.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:57.700
Zhiyan,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.540
you're studying abroad.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.100
Your focus should be on your major.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:07.780
Dad,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:09.860
there's something I need to tell you.

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.140
Go ahead.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.740
I actually

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.220
switched my major

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.460
to photography.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.020
Then switch back.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.660
You like photography.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.380
You can keep it as a hobby.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.900
There's no need to switch your major.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.420
Do you have any idea

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.980
how many people dream of getting

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.140
into your college's Business School?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:30.660
Dad,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.220
photography is my dream.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.700
I hope you can support me.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.700
Support you?

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.980
How will you support our family?

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.340
With your dream?

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.420
Have you forgotten?

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.660
You're the successor
to Starlight Jewelry!

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.860
I never wanted to be the successor!

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:44.780
Zhiyan.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.020
Say that again.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.180
Dad,

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.460
you never care about what I want.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.460
You have no idea what I really desire!

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.380
I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you.

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.060
I'm going to live my own life!

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:06.980
Song Zhiyan!

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.700
If you walk out that door today,

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.940
don't ever come back!

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:11.780
Fine.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:13.820
You said it!

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.140
Zhiyan.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.660
- Well...
- Zhiyan!

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:20.540
Dad.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.660
Don't be upset.

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:23.860
Sit down.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.860
Zhiyan's still experiencing
his rebellious period.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.380
There's no need to be angry with him.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.620
Yeah, Dad.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.740
He's probably just acting on impulse.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.700
Dad,

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.420
calm down.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.820
I'll talk to him later.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.220
Zhizhi, how was my acting?

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.980
If we hadn't planned this,

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.540
I would've believed it myself.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.060
I was acting,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.580
but Dad seemed really angry.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.820
It's fine. I'll go comfort him.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.420
Though our argument was staged,

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.300
I've been wanting to tell him
about switching my major for ages.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.460
I figured I might as well
just lay it all out today.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:22.660
Now I feel so much better.

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:24.860
Zhizhi,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.740
my transfer acceptance letter

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.860
will arrive in a few days.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.100
I probably won't be home much longer.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.660
I'm really going to miss you.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.580
I'll miss you too.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.500
But it's too dangerous here.

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.620
You'll be safer away from home.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.380
I understand, Zhizhi.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:47.460
Give me a hug.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.540
Zhiyan, you and Dad
mean the world to me.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.340
I will get to the truth.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.020
Sending you away

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.860
is the only way to keep you safe.

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.260
We were just figuring out
how to get close to her.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.460
Now she's just
coming right to us on her own.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.580
Even agreed to resume the engagement.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.180
What's her game?

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.020
Doesn't matter.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.140
We both get what we want from this.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:26.940
But

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.900
when she was desperate,

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.620
you were the first person she turned to.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.820
Doesn't that mean

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.100
she's into you?

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.860
It's because she's made

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.180
too many enemies.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.020
I'm just the only lifeline

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.780
she has left.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.220
You're something else.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.060
Stringing her along with false hope

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.580
before pulling the rug out.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.100
By the way,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.100
you asked me to check

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.540
the bank transfer records
of the Song family's staff.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.180
I found something.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.620
To get these records,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.420
I specifically consulted a lawyer,

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.780
explained the situation
to the public security authorities,

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.620
and signed all kinds

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.500
of legally binding affidavits.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.820
It was an arduous process

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.460
before the lawyer
finally provided them to me.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.740
Turns out, a large sum of money

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.900
was recently transferred

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.200
[Housekeeper, Zhu Yu]
into the account of Ms. Zhu,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.840
their housekeeper.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.140
And it happened on the day

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.900
Song Zhizhi and Song Zhiyan
were attacked.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:23.340
Can we trace who sent it?

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.260
You'll never guess.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.540
Just tell me.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.500
Come on, Ji Baijian.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.140
Nie Xiaofei

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.500
from the Song family.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.900
Surprised, huh?

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.900
Not really.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.260
The first time is never the last.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:58.580
Zhizhi,

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.380
is Zhiyan on his flight yet?

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:02.620
Don't worry.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.220
He's left safely.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:07.740
Just reach out to me

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.420
if you need anything.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.140
That won't be necessary.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.820
Remember, don't fall out with Yi Wenhan.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.740
You can use him
to uncover the truth behind all this.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:29.940
Wenhan,

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:31.620
you know,

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.860
what's done is done.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.260
There's no need to dwell on it.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.020
You're busy.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.260
You don't have to
hover over me every day.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.660
You should go.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.300
Get some rest, then.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.620
Song Zhizhi,

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:49.740
someday

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.780
you'll pay twice as hard

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:54.100
for humiliating me.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:04.780
Hello?

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:06.060
Ms. Song,

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.260
I've sent you some transfer records.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.740
You should look

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.260
into your housekeeper, Zhu Yu.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.020
Thanks. I'm already on it.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.140
Ms. Song,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.780
your brother is settled.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.820
He'll have protection.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:30.860
Also,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.220
we've compiled some data
on the kidnappers.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.060
Let's see if we can find

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.860
any clues about the person
behind all this.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.460
Understood.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.620
You may go now.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.540
I just heard

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.820
Song Zhizhi's secretary say

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.380
they have the kidnappers' profiles.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.060
What if they trace

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.020
the transfer records?

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.980
Do as my mom and I say.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.340
We'll handle your situation.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.500
Alright.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.100
I understand.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.420
Ms. Zhu.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.740
Zhizhi.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.100
Zhizhi,

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.340
you called me here in such a hurry.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.420
Is something wrong?

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:41.740
Grandma,

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.820
I asked you here today

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.820
to help us handle a serious matter.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.460
I just heard

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.660
Song Zhizhi's secretary say

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.980
they have the kidnappers' profiles.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.140
What if they trace

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.100
the transfer records?

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.420
Ms. Zhu.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.660
Mr. and Mrs. Song
have been so good to me.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.140
I've always done my best

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.540
to help them.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.820
Then how do you explain
the payment you received

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:20.940
on the day of the incident?

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.660
The transfer happened

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.900
before Zhiyan was attacked,

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.780
and it was

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.540
from Nie Xiaofei.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.140
Xiaofei,

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.060
explain this.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:41.300
What is going on here?

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:46.800
[Jincheng Bank]

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.520
[Transfer-To Zhu Yu, -¥300,000.00]

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.680
[Transfer-To Zhu Yu, -¥300,000.00]

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:56.660
Nie Xiaofei,

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:58.180
you may not be a Song,

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.140
but we've treated you well.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.700
How could you do something so vicious?

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.020
Well, I...

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:10.860
Xiaofei, you stupid girl,
are you mute now?

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:11.940
Say something!

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.700
You told me the other day

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.380
that Ms. Zhu's son needed surgery.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.060
Is it that transfer?

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:21.340
Yes.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.860
Look at me.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.540
I completely forgot about that.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.420
My memory isn't great either.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.980
I actually forgot
about Xiaofei's kindness.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.740
Aunt Wenzhi,

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:36.180
did you see it?

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:38.980
You knew it was the same transfer
without even looking?

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.220
Zhizhi,

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.820
I may not be young,

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.180
but I can remember what happened

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.980
just a few days ago.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.220
Alright.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.540
Do you know this person?

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.660
He's my ex-husband.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.300
Grandma,

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.340
Zhiyan

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.260
was kidnapped by her ex-husband!

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.540
Ms. Zhu,

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.580
tell the truth now!

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.700
What are you
and your ex-husband plotting?

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.140
Madam,

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.180
I'll confess.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.620
My child is sick.

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.740
My ex-husband is a hopeless gambler.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.220
He took our child's lifesaving money
to gamble.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.060
He lost it all.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.700
Debt collectors showed up
at our door threatening

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.700
to hurt my son

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.940
if we didn't pay.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.180
The creditors forced me.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.580
The call was meant for them.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.500
I had no choice.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:44.300
No choice?

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.060
So you hurt my son instead?

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.100
If it was just about money,

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.620
why did they want
to take nude photos of me?

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.100
Tell the truth!

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.380
Who put you up to this?

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.620
No one, really.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.220
I wasn't there,

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.780
so I don't know

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.100
what happened.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:18.700
Ms. Zhu,

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:23.340
if you don't come clean,

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.060
you'll spend the rest of your life
in prison.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.820
What will happen to your child?

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.220
Even if someone takes care of him,

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.820
it won't be with all their heart.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.620
After all, he's not their own child.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.100
Then,

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.540
how is he any different from an orphan?

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.180
Do you think it's worth it?

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.740
Zhizhi is right.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.660
Think of your child.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.060
Since Ms. Zhu has confessed,

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.420
everything is clear now.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:13.860
Honey,

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.580
let's just call the police.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.460
Let them handle it.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:17.220
Aunt Wenzhi,

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.540
why the rush?

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.220
She hasn't finished yet.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:26.220
Fine.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.300
Ms. Zhu, continue.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.380
Sir, Madam,

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.860
we did it for the money.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.460
No one put us up to it.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.540
I've failed you.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.380
I admit it.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.540
Tell Ms. Zhu that if the truth came out,

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.060
she had to take the fall alone.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.940
As for her connection to you,

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.220
she could pin it all
on the debt collectors.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.820
Do you know why I hit you?

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.420
Aunt Wenzhi brought you into our home.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:05.420
But you did something like this.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.580
If word gets out,

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.340
people might think
Aunt Wenzhi put you up to this

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.300
to take our family's fortune!

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.300
Wenzhi,

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.940
I gave you the power to run this house,

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.820
and I can take it back.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.180
So don't get any funny ideas.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.020
The Song family's fortune
belongs only to the Songs.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:28.820
Mom,

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.860
you've misunderstood me.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.140
I admit I made a poor choice in hiring.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.580
I'll correct it.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:36.980
Qing.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.420
Take Ms. Zhu away.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.620
Call the police later.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.820
Mom, I was wrong. I'll change.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.980
As for all that stuff you just said,

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.500
I wasn't even thinking any of that.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.740
All these years,

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.940
the Song family
has provided everything for me.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.540
Shan has always been good to me.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.500
He's never treated me poorly.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.780
I have all the food, clothes,

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.660
and everything else.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.300
Yeah, I have everything I need.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.300
So why would I think that way?

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.300
Mom, I'm content.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.020
I'm truly grateful

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:24.700
to the Song family.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.500
Honey.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.540
Honey, you know me.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.060
Always crying.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.700
Is that all you ever do?

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.900
So annoying.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.420
Shan.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.860
Come with me to get some fresh air.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.500
I'm exhausted from all that acting.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.100
My hand is red from hitting her.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:06.420
Zhizhi.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.340
That was...

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.940
That was all an act?

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.220
Yeah.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:16.460
Convincing?

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.700
Isn't that how you interrogate suspects?

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.900
Pretty convincing.

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.060
I almost believed it.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:27.420
Really convincing.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.980
Aunt Wenzhi, I'm going upstairs.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.700
I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.100
Okay.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:48.940
Hey?

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.540
You have no idea

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.860
how dramatic Nie Wenzhi
and Nie Xiaofei can be.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.420
They tag-teamed it

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.820
and almost smoothed
the whole thing over.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.180
They've been scheming for so long.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.460
Just shaking their foundation
is progress enough.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.700
Yi Wenhan was also
at the scrapyard that day.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.620
I knew they were in on it together.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.620
Keep an eye

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.420
on what kind of relationship
Yi Wenhan and Nie Xiaofei have,

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.260
and why they work together so smoothly.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.060
Between a man and a woman,
it's usually one of three things.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.740
Money, romance, or family.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.900
I checked their transfer records.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.580
No obvious transactions.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.980
Are they in a romantic relationship?

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.380
Doesn't seem like it.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.100
Yi Wenhan pretended to like me.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.620
But Xiaofei truly likes you.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.620
I could feel it.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.820
Then what's the reason?

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.540
Are you trying to drive me crazy?

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.620
Mom.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.260
I didn't mean to.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:46.740
Shut up!

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.540
So foolish.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.260
How could you transfer money to them

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.340
from your own account?

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.980
You'll be the death of me.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.740
At least now Song Zhiyan and Song Shan

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.020
are on bad terms.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.220
For now, he's not a threat to us.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.100
But Song Zhizhi

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.460
worries me more and more.

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.780
She used to be so easy to control.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.180
She was just

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.420
a spoiled

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:19.900
rich girl.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.540
But now,

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.980
she's not so obedient anymore.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:26.780
So you think the way she is now...

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.300
You really think she was acting?

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.860
I...

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.300
You.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.460
You foolish girl.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.220
What are we gonna do with you?

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.500
There's a long road ahead.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.380
Don't let me down.
