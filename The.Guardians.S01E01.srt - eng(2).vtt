In mid-1940,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.740
the War of Resistance Against
Japanese Aggression stalled.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.900
The open battlefield raged with gunfire.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.380
Covert fronts churned with tension too.

Here,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.180
dots and dashes of Morse code

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.540

The cipher system that encoded the codes

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.930
became walls and shields.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.820
Both sides used radio waves

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.380
The enemy's wall kept rising higher,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.540

At this point,

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.100
we can use the seed key,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.260
along with this F function,

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.260
to keep generating the key stream.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.570
The algorithm we're discussing

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.260
can basically be seen as

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.820
a type of symmetric algorithm.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.100

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.820
And back in college,

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.940
you focused on the XOR operation.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.820
My sources told me

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.060
that MSS's new cipher

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.820
was designed by

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.820
a brilliant British-Chinese mathematician
from Oxford.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.980
I figured it had to be you.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.730
That's right.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.610
You never let me down.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:56.130
So,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.420
can't crack it, can you?

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.820
How far have you got?

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.010
Tell me

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.370
the details.

00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:06.570
Do you know how many people died

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.330
at the Northern Jiangsu Front

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.860
just because of your cipher?

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.490
Just tell me,

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.010
how far you've cracked it now.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.810
So you think math is more important

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.140
than anyone's life, right?

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:25.620
It's about the math problem.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.900
You should look for answers in math,

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.180
instead of coming here

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.290
to threaten me by dragging

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.660
unrelated individuals in.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.570
You owe me all of this.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.050
This is our own battlefield.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.570
I want to see you with no way out,

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.570
watch your reputation crash.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:41.810
For every life lost here,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.620
I'll put the blame on you, Gu Yangshan.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.050
Alright.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.140
Then let's keep things professional.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:51.660
Back to the BIS.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.380
I have a hundred ways to make you talk.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.810
Gu Yangshan,

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.530
you've changed.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:02.140
Don't forget,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.900
you're still a mathematician.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.860
Now you're using

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.980
BIS tricks on me.

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.290
Come on, old friend.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.050
Let's keep some dignity here

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.860
and just walk out together.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.900
Alright.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.050
Mr. Lee.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.660
Mr...

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:42.330
Is this necessary?

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.330
Let me break it down.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:51.810
Before, I took one piece from one pile.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.660
But today, they gave two piles.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.620
Shouldn't I take two pieces?

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:57.730
I'll pay you.

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.610
Hey, man,

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.050
I'm just a bystander.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.530
But now, you're in this too.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.020
Come on, get up.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:11.850
Say it standing.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:14.370
No, it's comfier on my knees.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.610
Interesting.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:23.260
Who are you?

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.700
I'm not Joseph Lee.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.370
Of course I know.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:27.850
I'm asking about you.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:29.940
Who are you?

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:33.330
My name's Ding Yi.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.420
I'm an actor.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:37.850
Hey, man.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.370
Are you
from the Anti-Traitor Squad?

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:45.770
Yeah, that's right.

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.850
Come on, get up.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:50.850
Thanks, man.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:57.850
What's this?

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:00.610
Don't move.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.530
The faster you move,
the faster you die.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:04.610
It's a neurotoxin.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:06.770
If you don't get the antidote
in six hours,

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.090
you're done for.

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.610
Central nervous paralysis.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.330
You'll be suffocated to death.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.260
Sir.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.050
Sir.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.940
Don't kneel.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:19.420
My legs are giving out.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.810
Sir,

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:22.940
aren't you with the Squad?

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.460
Doesn't the Squad spare good people?

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.130
Yeah, we don't hurt the innocent.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.570
But right now, I can't tell if you are.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:31.290
Help me out first,

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:32.610
then I'll know if you're good.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.020
You don't even have a first aid kit.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.770
Come with me.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.900
Close the door.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.770
Manager, almost there.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.810
Alright.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.900
Taking me where?

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.660
Why are they here?

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.850
When class ended just now,

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:15.530
Takeda told me

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.090
he'd bring Kondo

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:18.290
to apologize to me personally.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.570
Didn't expect he'd come so fast.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:21.940
If you want to live, play along.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.090
Feels like I'm in a movie today.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.660
Way too intense.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.370
My head's still spinning.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.090
Keep acting as Joseph Lee.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.290
We need to shake them off.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:34.050
No tricks.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.530
Or neither of us will leave alive.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.370
Mr. Lee.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:46.330
Mr. Takeda?

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.020
Where are you headed?

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.660
Mr. Takeda, why are you here?

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.460
I just said earlier

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.330
Kondo needs to apologize to you.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.050
Did you forget?

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:02.530
I'm sorry

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.420
for what happened in class earlier.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:05.610
I acted out of line.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.050
I'm really sorry for that.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.700
Young people, you know.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.460
It's understandable.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.050
But keep this in mind,

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:18.740
if you don't get something,

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.090
keep it to yourself.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.050
That way,

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.130
no one will think less of you.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.290
Are you heading out?

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:35.290
What is it?

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.460
Mr. Takeda,

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.460
do I have to report

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.090
my whereabouts to you now?

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.940
Mr. Lee,

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:45.500
I'm just concerned

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.500
it might be hard for you to get around.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.980
Where are you going?

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.260
Let me arrange a ride for you.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.180
No need.

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:52.530
We have our own car.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.610
Hold on a sec.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.660
Let me help with your bags.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.610
Why are you all standing there?

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.370
Help Mr. Lee with his luggage.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:01.090
Got it.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.050
Charlie.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.610
We shouldn't let others carry our bags.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.370
Don't you know your place?

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.290
Can't you use your own hands?

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:26.850
Sorry, Mr. Takeda.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:27.770
Sorry for the awkward moment.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:30.940
My assistant just got back from the UK.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.850
He might still be jet-lagged.

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:33.810
So his mind

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.370
might be a bit fuzzy.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.100
Sorry, sir.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:42.610
Hello.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.370
I'm Charlie.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.610
Nice to meet you.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.130
Your Japanese is pretty good.

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.130
Impressive.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.650
Don't just stand there.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.130
We're in a hurry.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.580
Mr. Lee.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.380
Mr. Lee!

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.620
Hey man, slow down.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.100
Joseph Lee can't see a thing.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.100
Did you forget?

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.890
Sorry.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.570
Blue car on your right.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.100
Bro,

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:24.850
that's as far as I can go.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:25.940
Already a big help.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.940
Hand me the antidote.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.620
Drop me off somewhere quiet later.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.130
Just,

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:30.850
get yourself out.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:31.380
I can handle it.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.700
No, get in the car.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.370
I'm your boss.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.420
Get someone
to check the customs records.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.610
See if his assistant shows up.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.420
Man,

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.090
you've got nerves of steel.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.020
You should be an actor in our troupe.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.810
How about this,

00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.610
give me the antidote first.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.610
I need to get back and perform.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.370
My schedule's packed every day.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:24.700
Their moves seem off.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.050
Man,

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:32.530
what are you really after?

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.290
Can't you just listen to me?

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:48.660
Isn't that Kobayashi?

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.370
He's been trailing us.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.130
Stay calm.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.000
[Props Storage]

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.050
Why are we at the theatre?

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:45.420
Help me.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.570
Help me shake them off.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:25.980
I just arrived in Shanghai.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.340
I've already heard your name, Ms. Xian.

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.610
Mr. Takeda.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.060
You're in the wrong place.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.420
If you want to watch,
go to the audience.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.060
Your presence here

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.210
disrupts our work.

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.690
Why do you think I'm here for a show?

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.130
I'm actually looking for someone.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:51.610
Looking for someone?

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.420
I just spoke to Director William

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.420
from the Municipal Council.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.540
This is the Public Concession.

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.770
He knows a lot of people here.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.020
Want me to ask him for you?

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.380
It's alright.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:13.820
Before Director William arrives,

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.170
I'll find who I wanted.

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:21.610
Slow down.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:22.420
Be careful.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:29.290
Come on, make some space.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:31.820
Watch out, Mr. Takeda.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:33.380
Careful.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.130
Mr. Takeda.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.540
The show's about to start.

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.610
Let's go.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.210
Ms. Xian, aren't you on stage tonight?

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.210
I need to stay with you.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.250
Please, this way.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.170
Kondo, check over here.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:30.770
Alright.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.940
We'll look over there.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.380
Yes.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.250
Sir, the show's in the front.

00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:36.940
Move aside!

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.060
Where are we even going?

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.570
We're on the stage.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:56.250
Nothing here.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:57.690
Let's check over there.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.250
Alright.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:06.210
Hold on tight.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:16.420
Take it slow.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.020
Be careful.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.420
Mr. Takeda.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:44.610
This way, please.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:48.570
Have a seat.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.940
